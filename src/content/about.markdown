Hi there. I'm Bryan. Nice to meet you. No the pleasure is all mine.
What's that? You want to know more about me? Well, ok.

I just left my role as a Director at [Siberia][siberia]. I am currently based
in Brooklyn, NY.

For a long time I did freelance software development as an independent
contractor. Sometimes freelance meant contract work, where I'm essentially a
short term employee, and sometimes it meant project based work where I build
products or parts of products for individual clients. The project based work
tended to be my favorite because I got to be more involved in the process and I
like building things.

I consider myself a generalist when it comes to software development. I have
used and am comfortable using a five or six different server-side languages and
I have spent several years doing front-end development in HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. While I was doing contract work I would frequently get asked in
interviews whether I prefer server-side or client-side development and I never
had an answer because I enjoy doing both. Both "sides" of web development have
unique and thought provoking challenges to overcome and I enjoy the challenges
of both. Additionally, I have experience doing mobile development for Android
and some limited experience on the iOS platform though my knowledge of iOS is
out of date.

For the latter half of 2011 I was "out of the game" because I was doing
volunteer work for tsunami victims with my girlfriend in the Tohoku prefecture
of Japan. Prior to our month of volunteer work I was "taking time off" to work
on my pet project, [Persnicketly][persnicketly]. After the voluneering we spent
a little over a month and a half traveling around and then spent the holidays
with my parents.

If you're interested in talking I'm easy to get in touch with via
[email][email]. My work history is also easy to see, just head over to [my
resume][resume].
