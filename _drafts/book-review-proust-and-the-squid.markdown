I have tendency to oscillate between fiction and non-fiction in my reading habits. Most of the time the change is a concious decision, as it was this time. I had just finished *The Fuck-Up* and *gun, with occaisional music*[^1] and I needed to change things. It was with this in mind that I entered Book Court[^2] in pursuit of my next tome.
