	<p class="first">Once again through the business won by the team at the New York office of AKQA I worked on a project which was to serve as an internal resource for the marketing managers of Diageo for the Smirnoff brand. The development of this project was completed by myself and one of my colleagues in the Technology Department. For the majority of this project I served as the back-end developer customizing the version of the <a href="http://www.magnolia.info/home.html" title="Magnolia Content Management System">Magnolia CMS</a> we chose to build on top of by creating servlets for Ajax requests to interact with in order to streamline the content creation and display process.</p>
	<p>However, as the project experienced scope creep and a deadline drawing ever closer I was able to bring my front end development skills to bear in order to create the upload page pictured. The content nodes this upload page populated had only two required fields, title and description, the rest were optional but the information was sparse without it. The interesting thing about this form is it provided the ability to add any number of description blocks or gallery images.</p>
