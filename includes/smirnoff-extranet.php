	<p class="first">Once again through the business won by the team at the New York office of AKQA I worked on a project which was to serve as an internal resource for the marketing managers of Diageo for the Smirnoff brand. The development of this project was completed by myself and one of my colleagues in the Technology Department at the time. For the majority of this project I served as the back-end developer customizing the version of the <a href="http://www.magnolia.info/home.html" title="Magnolia Content Management System">Magnolia CMS</a> we chose to build on top of.</p>
	<p>However, as the project experienced scope creep and a deadline drawing ever-closer I was able to bring my front end development skills to bear in order to create the upload page pictured.</p>
