	<p class="first">This project's primary goal was to streamline the process in which retailers (paint selling stores) interact with their supplier (Benjamin Moore). The goal was to provide a central place for retailers to access nearly all the information relevant to their account. AKQA's plan for meeting this requirement consisted of a number of sliding panels which contain various sections or panels of content.</p>
	<p> User interaction on this page is fairly high in order to access all the information available, for example clicking on a tab slides the central panel over to cover the tab and reveals the related content. The JavaScript of the page is powered almost entirely by jQuery (1.2.6) and a few select plugins. Once integrated with the CMS and authentication there will be a number of different displays for various user roles. The displays will largely consist of a varying number of tabs in the top-most content panels.</p>
