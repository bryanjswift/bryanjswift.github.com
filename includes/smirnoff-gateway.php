	<p class="first">The team at AKQA's New York office were once again instrumental in enabling me to complete the work on the Smirnoff Gateway. There are a number of custom JavaScript components at work in this page the most notable of which is the keyboard navigation friendly select replacement for the country field. This field was the target of much criticism in the gateway which is currently in live on the <a href="http://smirnoff.com" title="Smirnoff">global Smirnoff brand site</a> because of how overly sensitive it is to the mouse wheel scrolling and how difficult it is to navigate with the keyboard.</p>
	<p>This updated gateway is unfortunately not currently viewable.</p>
