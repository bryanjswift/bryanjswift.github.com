One of the best things to ever happen to me on the internet happened tonight. My friend from volunteering in Ofunato posted a link on Facebook to some images taken from Google Maps Street View featuring a number of volunteers from All Hands including Mai and myself. Mai and I remember seeing the Google Street View car driving by and her waving to the man in the car and then looking around today it turns out [they used it](http://bit.ly/uJTTHB). Our faces our blurred out but there we are watching the car drive by and take pictures.

Panning up and down the street it is possible to see All Hands volunteer workers on the side of the road in a lot of the images. I can't really put my finger on why this is exciting to me but it is and it is awesome!
