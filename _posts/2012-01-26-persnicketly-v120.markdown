A new version of Persnicketly just went up and it includes a few changes in code organization but more importantly the RSS feeds are ready for prime time. They are now linked in the head sections of each listing page. In addition to the RSS feed links a new article time period was added enabling a peek into the, theoretically more volatile, last seven days of Readability articles.

The RSS feeds are accessed by adding `.rss` or `.atom` to as the extension of the list pages. The links are:

* [60 day feed](http://persnicketly.com/article/list.rss)
* [14 day feed](http://persnicketly.com/article/recent.rss)
* [7 day feed](http://persnicketly.com/article/week.rss)

These feeds have already made article discovery easier for the human so hopefully they are useful to others as well.
