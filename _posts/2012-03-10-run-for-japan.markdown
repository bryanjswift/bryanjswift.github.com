![Run for Japan on March 11th at 10:00 AM in Central Park](/assets/img/posts/run-for-japan/run_for_japan.jpeg)

Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami which devastated the east coast of northern Japan. And so [DoSoKai is putting on Run for Japan](http://www.facebook.com/runforjapan) for people to come out and show support the recovery and raise funds for earthquake / tsunami victims.

As you may be aware Mai and I have already donated time and travel to go to Japan and do volunteer work with [All Hands](http://hands.org/) in Ofunato and I am all to happy to continue to help in this small endeavor. So tomorrow I'll be donating some money and running (hopefully) 10k. I would be super grateful if folks would come and show their support as well. Either for me or for Japan or both.
