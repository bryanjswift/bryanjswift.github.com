![Run for Japan on March 11th at 10:00 AM in Central Park](/assets/img/posts/run-for-japan/run_for_japan.jpeg)

Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami which devastated the east coast of northern Japan. And so [DoSoKai is putting on Run for Japan](http://www.facebook.com/runforjapan) for people to come out and show support the recovery and raise funds for earthquake / tsunami victims.

As you may be aware Mai and I have already donated time and travel to go to Japan and do volunteer work with [All Hands](http://hands.org/) in Ofunato and I am happy to be able to continue helping even if only in this small way.

Tomorrow I'll be donating some money and time to run (hopefully) 10k. Mai and I will be at the [72nd St & 5th Ave entrance to Central Park](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=72nd+street+%26+5th+Ave,+new+york,+ny&hl=en&sll=40.694504,-73.956555&sspn=0.037744,0.055189&hnear=5th+Ave+%26+E+72nd+St,+New+York,+10021&t=m&z=16) tomorrow bright and early-ish at 09:00 to get registered and warmed up. I would be super grateful if folks would come and show their support as well. Either for me or for Japan or both.
