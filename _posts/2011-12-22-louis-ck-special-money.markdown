On the 10th of December Louis CK released a self-produced, DRM free comedy special [available for download for $5 (USD)](https://buy.louisck.net). He did it in part as an experiment to see if he could produce a comedy special of all new material his way and make a little dough. Shortly after he released it [Louis CK went on reddit and answered people's questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/n9tef/hi_im_louis_ck_and_this_is_a_thing/) about anything and everything.

I was never a huge fan of Louis CK's shows (and [I told him so](https://twitter.com/bryanjswift/status/147589560912711680) like an asshole), they didn't resonate with me. Maybe I just wasn't as in touch with my shame or as comfortable with it as I needed to be in order to appreciate Louis' brand of [shameful dirty comedy](http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/14480225720). As a result I never really watched his stand up. But I loved what he was doing producing and distributing his work on his own. He was taking a risk on what he believed in which is so in line with everything I believe in I couldn't help but buy the comedy special for the five dollars.

Apparently a lot of people felt the same way, or were fans, or whatever because he's sold a lot of copies of the special and he's giving about half the money away. Like a boss. Louis CK you've got a new fan.
