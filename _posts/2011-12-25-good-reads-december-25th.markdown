These are the interesting things in my Instapaper today.

1. *[One teachers approach to preventing gender bullying in a classroom](http://togetherforjacksoncountykids.tumblr.com/post/14314184651/one-teachers-approach-to-preventing-gender-bullying-in)* touches on some heavyweight gender issues. Gender issues are nothing new but I would never have thought about how young children absorb the gender norms. Thought provoking writing and an excellent approach to getting children to think about these tough issues.
1. *[Three at Last!](http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201112/west-memphis-three-trial-story-sean-flynn-gq-december-2011?printable=true)* reads like a condensed John Grisham novel, but it is a true story. It is distressing to have the 'pressure from on high' type of storyline illustrated in real life rather than as a poor plot line in a sitcom.
