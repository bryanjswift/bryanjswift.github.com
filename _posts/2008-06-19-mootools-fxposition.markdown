This is not a big landmark in the history of MooTools by any means but it means a lot to me. I just put what I hope to be the finishing touches on the first of what should be many Classes I've written for MooTools. It's not a terribly exciting or complex piece of code I think I just see it this way because it is really my first foray into providing some contribution besides a very little bit of knowledge and advice to an open source community.

The source is viewable at <a href="http://github.com/bryanjswift/mootools-plugins/tree/master" title="bryanjswift's mootools-plugins">my plugins repository on GitHub</a> and I certainly plan to continue to add more Classes as well as BDD specs and proper demos for them.

One down; many, many to go.
