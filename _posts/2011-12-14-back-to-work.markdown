It has been a while since I've put in work and it was grating on me after a couple of weeks back in the US of A. Almost automatically I opened up the source code to [Persnicketly](http://persnicketly.com) and started trying to add [Metrics](http://github.com/codahale/metrics) to it. Adding Metrics had long been on my list of things to do before leaving for Japan and it only seemed natural to pick up there. After a short while of staring at my old Scala code I realized my heart just wasn't in it. The realization was distressing, before leaving I had a long list of improvements and changes I wanted to make to Persnicketly and now I found myself almost entirely without motivation. In addition to the lack of motivation the bullet point of 'implement Metrics' was so broad I didn't have any sense of total scope or progress when I did work.

So I went back into perpetual day off mode; read the internet, check Twitter, check Facebook, check email, run, hang out with Mai. I needed something to grab my attention. Of course sitting where I am now I realize the fallacy there, I didn't need something to grab my attention but I did need something technical I could quickly succeed with. Ultimately this need is how I ended up with an [Octopress](http://octopress.org) powered blog running on [Heroku](http://heroku.com). All of my old writing from my blog is in here now (reading some of it makes me embarassed for myself).

Now that I've gotten myself back into work mode a little bit it is time to look for paying work. I have a couple of irons in the fire but nothing is looking quite ripe yet. Perhaps freelance is still the way to go for me.
