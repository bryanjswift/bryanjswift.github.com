I was reading <a href="http://lifehacker.com" title="Lifehacker">Lifehacker</a> the other day and found a link to <a href="http://www.scribefire.com/" title="ScribeFire">ScribeFire</a> which is an extension for the <a href="http://getfirefox.com" title="Get Firefox">FireFox</a> web browser aimed at making blogging easier by letting you do it from anywhere.

In the interest of trying things out I decided to take it for a spin, but I thought it only fitting that my first post from ScribeFire be <em>about</em> it, so here we are! Thus far I'm convinced it's a cool idea and like the quick and easy integration wizard it had when I first opened it which made setting it up to use with my blog super easy. It also has the option to open in a new tab rather than as a split view which I think is pretty useful. My biggest gripe is the minimum width the post area has. If you shrink it too small you start losing feature visibility and since I tend to not browse full screen I think not being able to resize the side panel may become annoying.

Overall first impression is good, I'd be even happier if it were a separate piece of software like an AIR app or something along those lines since I have moved away from using Firefox as my primary browser (except for debugging purposes) since moving to a Mac full-time.

Here's to happy blogging!
