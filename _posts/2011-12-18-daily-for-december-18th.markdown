Having Google App Engine charge me for my miniscule usage is pretty aggravating. It isn't a lot ($2.10) but my app ([Quote Crate](http://www.quotecrate.com)) is operating well within the free limits but I'm getting changed a minimum charge anyway. I just disabled billing which should fix this. However, it might be interesting to port the app to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and use [MongoHQ](http://mongohq.com) as the datastore. The searching could theoretically be done using Mongo's GridFS.
