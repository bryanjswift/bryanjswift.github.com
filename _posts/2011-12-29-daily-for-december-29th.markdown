The laziness is killing my spirit. I think I am beginning to understand how people spiral into depression. I'm not motivated to do anything so I don't do anything and quickly don't see the reason to be productive. I need to break the cycle tomorrow. Get up and go for a run in the morning and then go somewhere and work on something for a few hours at least. Staying in bed and padding my ratio is no longer acceptable use of my day.
