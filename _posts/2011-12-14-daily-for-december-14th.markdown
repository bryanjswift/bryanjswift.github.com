I'm going to try something starting with this post and see if I can stick to it. I want to write a quick daily summary at the end of each day. These don't necessarily need to be published but I think it will be instructive to have them.

This idea is one I had before in keeping a private journal in textile files but I ended up trying to be too organized an detailed. This experiment was triggered by a conversation I had with Justin. During the converstaion I realized I don't take time to reflect on what has been going on in my life.

Today I had two work related phone calls. The first was with Jake Levine of News.me. News.me is a service whose offering somewhat overlaps with Persnicketly. Jake had seen Persnicketly before I left for Japan and reached out so we could chat, today's phone call was the chat. We talked about how Persnicketly came about and what my plans were for it and he talked about what they were looking for. They need Python and iOS developers and I'm neither of those things so not much opportunity there but he said he would put me in touch with the VP of People at Betaworks of whom News.me is a subsidiary. Betaworks has a number of subsidiary companies and it is part of the VP of People's job to know what sort of people those subsidiary companies are looking for.

The second call was with Justin Court of OnwardSearch. Justin is a recruiter who wanted to place me for freelance work. We talked for a while but I don't think he can help me because I want too much money. I can live with that.

Much later I talked with Justin (Molignoni) about what was going on in his life and some more about how he thinks I should develop apps for the medical sector. I think there's truth in what he is saying but I don't have enough knowledge about what people there need and I can't work closely enough with someone who has the knowledge in order to really make it work. I think the needs are too specialized for a lay person (like myself) to whip some shit up and have it be helpful.

The other big development was writing Christmas cards for people. This is obviously Mai's influence but it wasn't entirely terrible and it made me think about people whom I haven't talked to in a while. In large part it made me miss my friends.
