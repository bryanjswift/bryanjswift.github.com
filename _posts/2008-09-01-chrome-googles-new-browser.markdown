I can't help but jump on the band wagon and be excited about the [new browser announced by Google][1] because from the ['viral' comic][2] they released and has been subsequently scanned in and posted on the web. The reason the new browser is so exciting is because of the process information Google claims will be available to users.

Personally I can't wait to get my hands on this gem when it is released and take it for a spin.
