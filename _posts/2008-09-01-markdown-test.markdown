I want to test[^1] the footnotes

How about lists?

1. first item

	first item continued
1. going to follow with some code

A code block will follow

	git svn rebase

*some stuff in italics* **some stuff in bold** [a link](http://google.com "a title") `this is code` [another link][1]

[1]: http://www.google.com
[^1]:Inline footnotes. But I bet it won't work. *it didn't* they have to be on their own.
