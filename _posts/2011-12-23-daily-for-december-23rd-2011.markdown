My foot is feeling better, not completely but at least I can walk like a normal human again. Hopefully tomorrow I can run.

I sent a follow-up email to Ryan Snyder at Simple because I hadn't heard back from him yet. He responded saying he would let me know next week what the next steps are. I can understand their wanting to take longer to get back to me and I was surprised when he said I would hear so quickly yesterday but I don't like being this bundle of nerves and I was hoping it would be over today.

It also means I definitely need to fill out the ridiculously long and somewhat invasive application form for Gilt Groupe or decide I'm not willing to provide all the information up front and see if they still want me to come in on January 9th for an interview.

I spent a lot of time reading today. Mostly reading things I had saved to Instapaper over the last several months. There are a lot of great articles in there and I'm glad I started to read them. I also have three books in iBooks, four in the Kindle application and two physical books all at hand waiting for my attention. Reading Instapaper may be a way to put them off, I'm not sure.

Movie time with Mai.
