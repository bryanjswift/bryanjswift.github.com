I just watched [Merlin Mann's Webstock 2011 talk](http://vimeo.com/21730173) and holy crap. There is something about [this](http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies) [guy](http://kungfugrippe.com) and the way he talks about fear I find resonates with me. He makes me want to build things and not just anything but great things.

I had an interview with Ian Collins and Toby Sterrett from [Simple](http://simple.com) today for a front-end engineer position. This is my second time trying to work for Simple because I am in love with their product and the engineering culture they are developing there. I thought the interview went alright other than them wanting everyone on the Engineering team to be in Portland. I can't tell how much my reluctance to move to Portland is a deal breaker there.

Afterwards I talked with Jer a little bit about Portland and how he likes the city and my total fear of leaving all the people I've come to love in New York. And as I said to Mom, asking Mai to move to New York with me is one thing but movingn to Portland is quite a bit different.

I read about [Louis CK's latest experiment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/n9tef/hi_im_louis_ck_and_this_is_a_thing/) on Reddit and despite not usually liking his stuff I spent the $5 to get the video because I wanted to support what he was doing. Then [I was a dick](https://twitter.com/bryanjswift/status/147589560912711680) and told him just that on Twitter and I can't explain why.
