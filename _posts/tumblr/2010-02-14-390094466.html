title: D'oh: GAELucene
---

<p>As I said <a href="http://tumblr.bryanjswift.com/post/390074190/sorry-google-i-jumped-the-gun">just a bit ago</a> I took a look at GAELucene and I guess I should have spent more time reading than writing because I noticed this bit on the project home page when I checked out the source code.</p>



<blockquote><p>The GAEDirectory is read only, that is, you can not use the Directory to build index! You should do indexing on another machine, then push the indices onto google appengine datastore with LuceneIndexPushUtil.</p>

<p>Because of the quota limitation of google appengine, GAELucene is not fit to run with huge indices, it does better for small indices, around 100Mb. For large changing indices, you need to find other solutions. </p>

<p>Since I am looking to use a changing index I fall into the category of &#8220;need to find other solutions.&#8221;</p>
