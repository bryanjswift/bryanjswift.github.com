title: Free as in Beer
---

<p>There is this colloquialism, &#8220;Free as in beer&#8221; in the open source software development community  which I&#8217;d never really understood. I wanted to know where these people lived and why they were giving away beer. Then I found the <a href="http://www.devtopics.com/beerware-software-license/">beer-ware license</a> (find <a href="http://people.freebsd.org/~phk/">another form of the beer-ware license</a>) and things began to make more sense. I&#8217;m not sure if this is actually where the term came from but I&#8217;m going to go with it.</p>
