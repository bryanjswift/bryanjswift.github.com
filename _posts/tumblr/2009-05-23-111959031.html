title: QuickTip: Coda's Open Quickly
---

<p>One of the oft touted features of TextMate is it&#8217;s ability to quickly open any file in the project. I&#8217;m a semi-regular TextMate user and I depend on this feature so much I&#8217;ve installed several plugins which replicate some of this functionality in Vim (or MacVim) which is my primary editor. Every once in a I use Coda to edit a site and I just discovered the Open Quickly command it includes. The shortcut to it is ^Q (Control-Q) which is a pretty different but this feature is so useful I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be able to remember it.</p>
