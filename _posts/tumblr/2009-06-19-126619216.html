It’s a sort of keyboard which lets you type glyphs not available on any of the standard iPhone keyboards. These glyphs include , ☂, ☺, ✔, and even ♫.</p>

<p>You may find this handy for Twitter, text messaging, emails, and I’m sure I don’t know what else. A clarification: unfortunately Safari won’t let you just tap a key to copy it; you have to hold and tap. I wish you didn’t, but there.</p>

<p>On the flip side, even though it’s a web app, once you’ve installed Glyphboard it will work even when you’re offline. How’s <i>that</i>!</p></blockquote>
