title: What I learned today
---

<p>I found a couple of new and interesting bits about languages and applications I use on a daily basis. I love it when that happens.</p>



<h3>Scala</h3>



<ul><li><code>Option(null)</code> returns None (in 2.8)</li>

<li><code>Option(_)</code> where _ is a non-null value returns Some(_) (in 2.8)</li>

</ul><h3>Vim</h3>



<p>When navigating in normal mode after leaving insert mode <code>gi</code> can be used to jump back to insert mode at the location of the last edit.</p>



<p>I also learned Ubuntu, in 9.10 (Karmic Koala), is using CouchDB to store a number of application specific settings.</p>
