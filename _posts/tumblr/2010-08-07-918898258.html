title: ScrollView vs EditText: FIGHT!
---

<p>I had a ScrollView wrapping an EditText in an application I was writing because I wanted the fling behavior ScrollView provided. EditText on it&#8217;s own simply stopped moving when the user lifted a finger from the display and it felt awkward. However, when I had a lot of text in the EditView, enough that the fling mattered, things would jump all over the place. I spent hours trying to figure out which touch event or MotionEvent I needed to catch and stop from propagating and under what circumstances. Nothing seemed to do the trick.</p>



<p>After sleeping on this bug for the third night I was looking through the source of the EditText class hierarchy (I&#8217;m soooo glad this OS is open source) and I found <code>requestRectangleOnScreen</code>. It turns out whenever I tapped the screen this guy was getting called and causing the ScrollView to jump all over the place, most frequently to where the cursor last was. So I created a custom EditText extension and overrode the method. The full source is below:</p>
