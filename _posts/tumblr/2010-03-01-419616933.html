title: User Agent Detection in Java
---

<p>I was looking for a way to detect mobile devices in Java and hoping someone had done the heavy lifting for me. It turns out someone had. There&#8217;s a port of a PHP script I found at <a href="http://www.hand-interactive.com/resources/detect-mobile-java.htm">Hand Interactive</a> that looks like it does what I need.</p>



<p>Basically if I detect a mobile device I want to use a different stylesheet on <a href="http://www.quotecrate.com">Quote Crate</a> but I didn&#8217;t want to have to find all the user agent strings myself. This should work nicely. I&#8217;ve loaded the file into a <a href="http://gist.github.com/318237">Gist on Github</a> and plan to make some improvements to it.</p>
