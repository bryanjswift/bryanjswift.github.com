title: More Writing Please
---

<p>There have been a number of times where I&#8217;ve tried to start writing (words not code) more. I enjoy putting pen to paper and making the clackety noise to produce something. My problem is I&#8217;m never really sure what to write about.</p>



<p>A little while ago I realized I tend to learn new and useful things pretty often but then forfet them because I only need to use the knowledge once and don&#8217;t use the needed tricks to get the bit of information into my brain.</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s the plan, I&#8217;m going to try and write down and then write about the things I learn each day. I hope this works out for me and provides a useful reference.</p>
