title: Why Quicksilver? WHY?!
---

<p>I really like Quicksilver. It is one of those applications I wonder how people can be on a Mac and <em>not</em> utilize it. While it has been out of active development for a while now I still find it eminently useful. However, I do have to re-launch at least once a day because it tends to have it&#8217;s catalogs get confuzzled and the only way I can find to un-confuzzle it is to relaunch it. I recognize this as a minor flaw for a tool I use every day and never made it out of beta but anyway to remedy it would decrease my daily frustrations levels a bit.</p>
