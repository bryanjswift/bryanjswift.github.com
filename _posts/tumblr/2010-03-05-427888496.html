<blockquote><p>Reading C&amp;C in bed for the first time, having sufficiently worked through both as part of our “meet” “up” — I couldn’t justify taking it into the steamroom with me. Which is my substitute for wet-making, lick-the-salt-off-my-cheeks sex, but not a very safe place for much else let alone reading!</p></blockquote>



<p>The phrase &#8220;lick-the-salt-off-my-cheeks sex&#8221; is just too evocative to not love it. I&#8217;m quite excited for this book.</p>
