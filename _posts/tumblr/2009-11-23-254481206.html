<p>Poedit is a useful tool for providing source files and having it extract text based on specific keywords. I used this for a Facebook application and it seems to be pretty speed, likely this is because it is &#8220;harcoded&#8221; so it essentially does a lookup. In any case this could be useful in languages other than PHP as well if there are libraries to interact with it.</p>



<p>A couple personal learning. I&#8217;ve been drinking more coffee lately. This started because of some rough nights and hence tired mornings but I discovered I&#8217;m actually enjoying it. Also my tastes in general seem to be changing. For example I had a tasty pickle the other day. I used to really dislike pickles.</p>



<p>Lastly for today I&#8217;ve come to accept I am in fact a smoker. I smoke infrequently because of the health concerns but I&#8217;ll smoke &#8216;em if you&#8217;ve got &#8216;en.  I feel this is the same sort of important personal admission as admitting to a drinking problem.</p>
