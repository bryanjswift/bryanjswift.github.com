title: Sorry Google, I jumped the gun.
---

<p>I recently <a href="http://twitter.com/bryanjswift/status/9121383956">tweeted</a> that something broke when I updated my <a href="http://www.quotecrate.com">Quote Crate</a> application from version 1.2.5 of the AppEngine SDK to version 1.3.1. As it turns out this was unfair to Google (sorry). It doesn&#8217;t appear to have had anything to do with the SDK change but rather my poor implementation of Lucene for the AppEngine datastore.</p>



<p>Since the data in my application was all my test data I wiped it all and and tested the application again. Much to my surprise, with no data entries saved without a problem until I had nine entries. After the ninth entry it started dying again. This, along with the still failing after rolling back to 1.2.5, makes me pretty certain it&#8217;s my code and nothing to do with the AppEngine.</p>



<p>So it seems it&#8217;s time to go back to the drawing board on how that all operates but it looks like someone else has tackled the Lucene on AppEngine problem in the form of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gaelucene/">GAELucene</a> on Google code. I&#8217;m going to dig through this a bit and see how that works and if I can take some inspiration from it in order to clean up my code.</p>
