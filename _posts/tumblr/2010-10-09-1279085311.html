title: Helping Perch Out
---

<p>I just &#8216;finished&#8217; building my first site using <a href="http://grabaperch.com">Perch</a> which is a great little CMS. I did have a couple of usability issues with editing long lists of items so I whipped up a JS file that can be included as a perch plugin to help out.</p>



<p>The files from the <a href="http://gist.github.com/618707">perch usability plugin gist</a> should show up below.</p>
