I've been having issues with my joints and specifically my knees lately. Needless to say it's not a lot of fun. However, the pain has been quite manageable and though I had an undeniable limp I could still get around without too much trouble.

Yesterday I woke up with a puffed up knee full of fluid but I could still get around so I didn't make a fuss about it. Then last night I flew out to see my parents in Southern California and having it basically immobile for around six hours certainly didn't help things. Finally when I stood up to get out of my seat and off the plane my left knee twisted and I felt a pretty uncomfortable pop. The pain has subsided substantially since last night but I'm headed in to see an orthopedic surgeon this afternoon. Hopefully I'll be able to return to New York City on Monday as scheduled but at this point it seems questionable.
