Neat little application I've never used but have heard good things about called <a href="http://humanized.com/" title="Enso">Enso</a> has opened its doors and is giving away software candy! Enso is in a similar vein to Quicksilver as I understand it; they both try and make things that should be easy actually easy. Crazy right!
