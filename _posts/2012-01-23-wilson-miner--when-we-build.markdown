I just watched [@wilsonminer](http://twitter.com/wilsonminer)'s [talk for build conf 2011](http://vimeo.com/34017777)[^1]. It is an inspiring and nourishing talk about why the job of software design and development is awesome and world changing and wonderful. It is one of the best things I could have spent forty minutes watching.
