[This kind of misinformation](http://mediamatters.org/blog/201112120005) or at best inattention to detail is why everyone needs to be skeptical of the media. But media skepticism is _really_ hard with things like these graphs they can be flashed on screen and all people are left with is the impression of the trend line. People don't dissect everything they see on TV or read in the newspaper or read on the internet. There is an implicit relationship of trust without which these distribution channels don't really work.
