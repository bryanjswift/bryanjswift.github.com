I just got back from the orthopedic surgeon I've been seeing while visiting my parents and after looking at my MRI film from last July and the film from the MRI I got taken on Saturday he concluded there is nothing wrong with my knee. This is both good and bad news, at least to me. The reason it's good news is relatively obvious, there's nothing wrong with my knee and hence no need for surgery.

The bad news is a little less obvious but quite real. Since there is nothing apparent wrong with the joints causing me pain and problems the most likely cause is something like Rheumatoid Arthritis, which at the age of 26 and knowing that this has been affecting me for at least three years is a little difficult to come to terms with.

I guess I won't know for sure until I get back to the city and see a rheumatologist (sp?) but I have to kind of operate under the assumption it's something systemic rather than a problem with one specific joint.
