I realize to date the posts here have been largely technical or technology related and that was my original intention for how to use it when I decided to begin posting again largely because I had come into some freelance web development and I felt like I needed a place to talk about work related things I have done, heard about, or been interested in recently. However, if I take a closer look at the things I've written none of them are really solid technical advice and to be perfectly honest I've had to post updates in the posts I felt were going to be most technically useful stating I was wrong or incorrect in some assumptions. This all basically brought me to the conclusion (along with non-existent readership) I can do whatever the heck I want here. It is after all my sandbox.

So without further ado...
