I'm not totally sure what happened after I got this site up and running but it has clearly been stagnant for a while. Two things have happened recently though which have prompted me to attempt to turn things around.

First, client work for my full-time job has gone from <em>crazy</em> to relatively normal. And second, I've decided I would like to try and do some freelance work. So the first thing I have to do is create some kind of showcase for what I can do. Right now I've got two plans on how I'm going to this happen. The first is a freelance project I'm working on and the second will be creating a custom theme for this here wordpressery.
