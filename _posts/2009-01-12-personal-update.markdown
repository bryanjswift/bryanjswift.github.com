It's been a while since I've felt compelled to write about what has been going on, but hopefully my renewed interest in personal projects and the possibility of some upcoming freelance work will put me back on track with the semi-regular posting here.

I can't and won't promise much, but not having to log into a web browser to write posts I feel is going to help a whole lot as well. For some reason it feels more like I'm composing an email than a blog post now; I can tell because I feel compelled to say "Cheers" at the end which is my typical email sign-off.
