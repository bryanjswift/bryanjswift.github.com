I'm heading off to Boston to attend An Event Apart tomorrow and I'm pretty excited about it. I've never been to anything conference like before and so I'm really not sure what to expect but I am hoping to meet some good people while listening to informative talks about the stuff on the web and the parts of web development that really interest me.

I'm sure I'll have more to say about it once I'm there and in the thick of things so that is all for now. Bags packed ready to travel.
