In starting to use this blog again I have come to the conclusion that I am not particularly fond of any of the themes I've used, probably in large part because I'm not totally sure where to start in order to customize them. As a result I think I'm going to take a foray into creating my own theme but for now I think I'm going to leave the 'classic' wordpress theme in place because I like it's minimalist approach.

I do have a curiosity though, where can I find the set of test posts used on some of the theme websites? If anyone finds this and knows I'd appreciate the help. I think I'm going to try and keep the theme I create a minimal, two-column, fluid theme. Structure first, layout later.
