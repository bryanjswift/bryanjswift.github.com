Last night I dove a little deeper into the pieces that make wordpress tick and put together the admin panel for the theme I've been building. My goal is not just to make the theme pretty, flexible and readable but also to make it pretty customizable. After all I know my tastes are not like everyone else's and so why should I limit use of the theme to people that want to do things like me?

Anyway the theme is in much better shape now than it was a little while back and I'm proud to say I'm ok with it enough to use it here (as you may have noticed you phantom reader you). Anyway the theme is looking alright and it's even got options now which I think is pretty exciting. It's not an official release yet because I still want to fix it up some more and give it some more options before creating an 'official' release.
