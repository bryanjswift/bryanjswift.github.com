Recently I've been making a lot of use of a site I found a while ago called stikkit. Stikkit is basically a online cork board for post-it notes. At least that is how I've come to think about it. So essentially I'm using it for everything from storing links I want to revisit later but don't necessarily want to bookmark to keeping freelance hours logged.

This process of keeping stikkits up to date and useful is made even easier but a great <a href="http://interblah.net/2007/4/3/stikkit-dashboard-widget" title="stikkit dashboard widget">dashboard widget</a> which uses your api key to access your stikkits in order to display and update them.
