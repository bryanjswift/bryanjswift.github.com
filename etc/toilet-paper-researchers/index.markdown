Finding things like <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26759554/" title="Toilet-paper researchers create 3-ply tissue">an article about toilet paper research</a> is part of what I love about twitter. I don't spend enough time reading news, off-beat or otherwise, and twitter tends to point me at articles I would otherwise never see. This gem is courtesy of a <a href="http://twitter.com/simplebits/statuses/926029877">tweet</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/simplebits" title="Twitter / simplebits">Dan Cederholm</a>.

> If two-ply toilet paper is good, then three-ply tissue must be better. At least that's what
> toilet-paper researchers in northeastern Wisconsin hope.

Thanks Dan.
