Hi there. I'm Bryan. Nice to meet you. No the pleasure is all mine. What's that? You want to know more about little old me? Well, ok.

I do freelance software development. I am based in New York City. Sometimes freelance means contract work, where I'm essentially a short term employee, and sometimes it means project based work where I build sites or parts of sites for individual clients. The project based work tends to be my favorite because I get to be a lot more involved in the process and I like building things from scratch.

I consider myself a generalist when it comes to my development skills. I have used and am comfortable using a five or six different server-side languages and I have spent several years doing front-end development in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In interviews I get asked frequently whether I prefer server-side or client-side development and I never have an answer because truthfully I thoroughly enjoy doing both. Both "sides" of web development have unique and thought provoking challenges to overcome and I love the challenges of both. Additionally, I have experience doing mobile development for both the Android and iOS platforms.

For the latter half of 2011 I was "out of the game" because I was doing volunteer work for tsunami victims with my girlfriend in the Tohoku prefecture of Japan. Prior to our month of volunteer work I was "taking time off" to work on my pet project, [Persnicketly](http://persnicketly.com). After the voluneering we spent a little over a month and a half traveling around and then spent the holidays with my parents.

Now I'm back and still working on Persnicketly, but I'm also looking for paying work. I'm easy to get in touch with via [email](mailto:bryan.j.swift@gmail.com). My work history is also easy to see, just head over to [my resume](/portfolio/resume.html). If you have already seen my resume you could look at [my portfolio](/portfolio/).
