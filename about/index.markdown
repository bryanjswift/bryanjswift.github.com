<p><strong>Name:</strong> Bryan J Swift</p>

My job, despite having engineer in the title, is mostly about developing for the web. Lately I've been working primarily with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript but my background is in server side languages most specifically in Java. I've also been working on learning <abbr title="ActionScript">AS</abbr>3, <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, Scala, and Clojure lately for my own uses and projects.

I can be reached by <a href="mailto:bryan@bryanjswift.com" title="Email Bryan J Swift">email</a> or on AIM at bryanjswift for questions regarding freelance work, rates, or just general questions.
