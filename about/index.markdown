My job, despite having engineer in the title, is mostly about developing for the web. Lately I've been working primarily with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript but my background is in server side languages most specifically in Java. I've also been working on learning <abbr title="ActionScript">AS</abbr>3, <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, Scala, and Clojure lately for my own uses and projects.

I enjoy doing web development and to some extent server maintenance. I also tend to feel like the web accessibility evangelist in my office though I don't believe I know enough about accessibility for it to really be true.

There isn't really a definite direction for this site just yet, though I have been using this domain as both a test bed for personal projects and freelance projects.

I am looking to take on some more freelance work since things have been kind of slow lately and I could use the extra money.

I can be reached by <a href="mailto:bryan@bryanjswift.com" title="Email Bryan J Swift">email</a> or on AIM at bryanjswift for questions regarding freelance work, rates, or just general questions.
