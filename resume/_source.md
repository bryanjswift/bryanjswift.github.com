## Recent Job History

### Siberia, LLC from November 2014 until December 2019

Siberia is a product design focused consultancy, as such the specifics of the role shifted from client to client and project to project. Broadly speaking, as a director of engineering at Siberia my role was part consultant, part craftsperson, part educator and coach. My day to day responsibilities involved heads down implementation work, leading the team of engineers on my project (or projects) and staying in touch with the client contacts while mentoring and coaching the members of the wider Siberia engineering organization.

Directors at Siberia get involved at each step of the lifetime of a client engagement â€” from the identification of an opportunity and pitch, through project execution and delivery and on to relationship growth and afterwork. Because of this directors must be multi-functional, while skillfully executing in their primary vertical they must also be able to understand and lead during any step of the product design and implementation process.

During my tenure at Siberia I led teams on a variety of ventures for clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies with a focus on craft and meticulous execution. My work on these projects has helped some of the worlds most beloved brands more efficiently achieve their business goals and bring delight to customers through user experience focused and technology solutions.
