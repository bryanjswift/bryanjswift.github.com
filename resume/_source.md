### Siberia, LLC from November 2014 until December 2019

Siberia is a product design focused consultancy, as such the specifics of the

heads down implementation work, leading the team of engineers on my project (or

Directors at Siberia get involved at each step of the lifetime of a client
engagement â€” from the identification of an opportunity and pitch, through
project execution and delivery and on to relationship growth and afterwork.
Because of this directors must be multi-functional, while skillfully executing
in their primary vertical they must also be able to understand and lead during
any step of the product design and implementation process.

During my tenure at Siberia I led teams on a variety of ventures for clients
ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies with a focus on craft and

delight to customers through user experience focused and technology solutions.

Due to the contracts I accepted the role on each project varied from creating

sprawling JavaScript and CSS front end code bases.
