                Having taken almost no time off since starting as an
                independent contractor, I opted for a sabbatical to pursue
                other interests. I spent the first two months working on a
                personal project (Persnicketly, which has since been shut down)
                and finishing up the last of my existing client work. Towards
                the end of those months I was also planning out an
                international vacation with my girlfriend and learning
                Japanese. On September 2nd we landed in Japan and headed to
                Ofunato in the Iwate prefecture to do tsunami relief work until
                September 30th. Following the relief work we traveled through
                Japan, visited Singapore and then toured New Zealand before
                arriving in California to spend the holidays with my parents.
