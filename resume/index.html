        United Income is a registered investment advisor and was acquired by
        Capital One in mid-2019. United Income combines financial planning
        software with experienced wealth advisors in order to provide nuanced
        and personalized financial planning services to help customers

      <p>
        In my time with United Income I have established a forum for the
        engineering team to share their in progress work in order to receive
        feedback from their peers. I have also been collaborating with the
        enterprise identity teams to define how United Income will integrate
        with Capital One's digital identity system to use a customer's Capital
        One credentials for authentication.

        Siberia is a product design focused consultancy, as such the specifics
        of my role shifted from client to client and project to project. Broadly
        speaking, as a director of engineering at Siberia my role was part
        consultant, part craftsperson, part educator and coach. My day to day
        responsibilities involved heads down implementation work, leading the
        team of engineers on my project (or projects) and staying in touch with
        the client contacts while mentoring and coaching the members of the
        wider Siberia engineering organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Directors at Siberia get involved at each step of the lifetime of a
        client engagement â€” from the identification of an opportunity and pitch,
        through project execution and delivery and on to relationship growth and
        afterwork. Because of this directors must be multi-functional, while
        skillfully executing in their primary discipline they must also be able
        to understand and lead during any step of the product design and
        implementation process.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my tenure at Siberia I led teams on a variety of ventures for
        clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies with a focus on
        craft and meticulous execution. My work on these projects has helped
        some of the worlds most beloved brands more efficiently achieve their
        business goals and bring delight to customers through user experience
        focused and technology solutions.

        As an independent contractor my role was either sole developer for a

        international agencies working on long term, large scale rewrites of
        legacy code bases.

      <p>
        My role on each project varied from creating and consuming REST APIs in
        Scala, creating Android applications in Java, integrating with and

        JavaScript and CSS front end code bases.
