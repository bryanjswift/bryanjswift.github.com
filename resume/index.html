        Siberia is a product design focused consultancy, as such the specifics
        of my role shifted from client to client and project to project. Broadly
        speaking, as a director of engineering at Siberia my role was part
        consultant, part craftsperson, part educator and coach. My day to day
        responsibilities involved heads down implementation work, leading the
        team of engineers on my project (or projects) and staying in touch with
        the client contacts while mentoring and coaching the members of the
        wider Siberia engineering organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Directors at Siberia get involved at each step of the lifetime of a
        client engagement â€” from the identification of an opportunity and pitch,
        through project execution and delivery and on to relationship growth and
        afterwork. Because of this directors must be multi-functional, while
        skillfully executing in their primary discipline they must also be able
        to understand and lead during any step of the product design and
        implementation process.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my tenure at Siberia I led teams on a variety of ventures for
        clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies with a focus on
        craft and meticulous execution. My work on these projects has helped
        some of the worlds most beloved brands more efficiently achieve their
        business goals and bring delight to customers through user experience
        focused and technology solutions.

      </h3>
      <p>
        As an independent contractor my role was either sole developer for a
        project or staff augmentation for a client's development team. My
        clients ranged from individuals in need of a personal site to local
        restaurants opening their doors for the first time through to
        international agencies working on long term, large scale rewrites of
        legacy code bases.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role on each project varied from creating and consuming REST APIs in
        Scala, creating Android applications in Java, integrating with and
        building on top of PHP CMS frameworks and contributing to sprawling
        JavaScript and CSS front end code bases.
