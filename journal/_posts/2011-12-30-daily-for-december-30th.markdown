After spending a lot of time writing and thinking (new pens yay!) last night I concluded I am not willing to relocate to Portland even if it is to work at what I think is my perfect startup. The reasons are many but it boils down to there being more to my life than work and I don't want to abandon the rest of my life for a job, even if it is a great one. Another large consideration is if I only have a year and a half left in this country because Mai wants to go somewhere and teach I would much rather it was with friends I already have than trying to make new ones.

I emailed Ryan at Simple and told him the short version with a tentative plan for spending one week every month in Portland with the team. Ryan quickly got back to me saying the relocation was required and thanking me for being up front about it. I'm bummed it won't work out but it wasn't a ploy and I'm satisfied with my decision.

I also sent an email to Maureen at Gilt explaining my feelings about the application she asked me to fill out. I am going to fill out the things I am comfortable filling out and submit it and we will see where and if it goes.

Yesterday I got a call from Brian Jeremy who mentioned he had a line on a relatively long term freelance project for Amtrak and asked about my availability. We talked about my interest in Simple and how the situation there might influence my availability but I shot him an email and told him what happened with Simple so we will see if the project gets going and if he needs me for it.

I feel like a different person today than I did the last two days and I think the excessive amount of reflection I put myself through last night is a big part of it.
