## 11:47:38 AM EST

I got up and went for a run this morning and felt better running than I had in a while do I just kept going. And going. And going. I turned around and came back because I was starting to worry I might not be back in time to shower before my call at noon. 

As it turns out it is good I tired back when I did. I got back to the apartment around 11:35 after running for an hour and six minutes. That is about twenty minutes linger than my previous longest run. Now I'm showered and mostly ready for this guy from Knewton to call me.

Talked to Dave Garfinkel of Knewton after some delay. Seems like I am basically starting the process fresh because input him off for so long. It is fine though because I don't think we ever got much farther than "hey would you maybe be interested in this gig."

I pointed him to my Persnicketly stuff on GitHub and one of the engineers is going to take a look and Dave will get back to me about next steps. 

Presently walking across the Manhattan Bridge to spend a little time working from Miami Ad School in Dumbo.

Spent some time working on Persnicketly today from Miami Ad School. I was trying to put together an attractive single article view based on the mobile design Diesel had provided a while back. I like the way the mobile design looks for small screen but it looks jumbled together when viewed at large browser widths which is the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. I think the design for this needs to be more flexible on the white space and the headlines are too dominant when using the yellow from the article list page.

Functionally though it is pretty well put together. However, I did make a change to store more information for each article viewed on the single page. In theory this is fine but I'm concerned that in practice it will bloat the index size of the articles collection causing the whole operation to be slower.
