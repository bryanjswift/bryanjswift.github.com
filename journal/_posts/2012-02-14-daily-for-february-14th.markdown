# February 14, 2012

Up at 06:30 to run before getting in the shower to go meet Darrell by 08:15. Only I ran too long, over to west side highway and 12th St , and got back late. So I rushed through my shower and didn't eat breakfast. Just grabbed a banana on my way out the door. Hopefully they will have food at grind or my body is going to be mad at me. 

I really hope this leads to work.

Interesting talk by Anil Dash at grindspaces about the state of the web and the danger of social service lock in. He also talked about some ways to mitigate the lock in and asked for more awareness about how social networks can use the data you give them, specifically about who owns the data. 

Anil also talked about what he would like to see from the next big thing. Essentially something which allows more freedom in order to enable some serendipity. One way to do this might be to build in some awareness of who is looking at your content now. 

I have had feelings about wanting to know who was looking at my blog and wanting to converse with them when I see people on it from the live view from gaug.es. I wonder how that could work without being creepy about storing conversations.

After Anil's talk I sat down with Darrell and Richard (Technology Experience @ co) and Ryan (designer @ co) to talk about some work they would want me to do for grind at SXSW. The work sounds interesting and spans a lot of different technologies but the timeline is super short. On the other hand I worked up an estimate and it isn't like I wouldn't get a fair bit of money for it.

I have two primary concerns:

1. The complexity of the visual designs, if it is high I'm kind of screwed
2. Interacting with an RFID reader connected to the desktop.

If there isn't a relatively simple API or piece of software to interact with the RF reader the complexity of the read and display process goes _way_ up which could be problematic for both time put in and the technical feasibility in general.
