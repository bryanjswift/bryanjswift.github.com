Beta woke Mai and I up crying. Fortunately I listened to sense and took him out because we got about six steps into the walk before she squatted and peed. 

Came in and going back to bed.

Up for real now and made Kai waffles for breakfast. I had some yogurt and granola. Kai is playing Little Big Planet and has been since I came out at 07:30, probably before as well. Hopefully not since 05:30 when I got up to take Beta out.

Took Beta out before we left for VA and he peed right away. Sort of as reward I took him to the dog run to play for a little while. There were a couple other dogs at the run so we stayed for a little while and he made friends and pooped and made more friends. Now we are headed to the car so we can drive and get some furniture for the apartment.

Traffic was kind of a mess around DC but my sped most of the way so we ought to at U-Haul in plenty of time. Beta has been really good in the car, just laying in the back seat resting.

We got to Dave's with the truck safely and started moving things into the garage as a staging area. Dave and Yuri came home just around the time we finished taking everything down and wanted to help. 

Once everything was down I started loading the truck but Dave quickly decided he knew better. Maybe he did but I just let him do it his way. It wasn't worth making a stink about and I know he is just trying to be helpful. 

The truck is loaded with the things that are ready, except for the New York puzzle whose frame I broke while helping load the truck, and Mai doesn't have the rest of her things ready do I'm on break.

We have all of Mai's packed stuff in the truck. There are still some things out and around the house she needs to take care of but I think it is done for this trip. 

Just before putting the last of the boxes into the truck I took Beta for a short walk so he could pee but he didn't want to be outside so I let him come back in without peeing. We moved the last of the boxes into the truck and then I started getting ready for bed. While I was brushing Beta peed on the rug in the hallway. I'm really disappointed because we had done so well with not pottying in the house yesterday and up until just now today. The two things bothering me most about it are his behavior on the most recent walk where every time I would walk away from the house he would tug me back to it and his complete lack of any sign i noticed to tell us he needed to pee. He did jump up at me when we came back in and I took his leash off. But it isn't unusual for him to be all jumpy after we come inside.

I had a revelation of sorts tonight as well. I was looking at the bed we want to get to order it online and the total came to a little over $1800. I was going to put it on my Bank of America Visa card but I don't have enough available credit on it or my American Express. Worst of all taking it out of my checking account would take me down to about $2300 which would put me in the realm of broke. 

There is still a little money left because I think I will be able to take some of my "tax savings" money back. Despite that I am definitely starting to feel some stress over money and I don't like it. It isn't something I have ever experienced and I am not sure how to deal with it. The most obvious answer is to get back to work but I need to find something first. 

I could try to take out a line of credit with Bank of America again and consolidate my debt I am getting charged a lower interest rate. In fact I should do that even if only to save me money on the crazy interest American Express is charging me. 

Sometimes the realities of adulthood fucking suck.
