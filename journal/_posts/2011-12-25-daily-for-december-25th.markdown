Christmas Day! 

Mai's friends can't remember there is a three hour time difference between the east and west coasts and so her phone started buzzing away at about 06:30. We managed to sleep through it in fits and starts. Up around 08:50 to go for a run knowing we are going to have fairly unhealthy food choices for mealtimes today. It is like a pre-emptive strike for our diet.

Jer's flight was delayed about an hour [(and it doesn't seem like he enjoyed it)](https://twitter.com/jeremyswift/status/150954195472748544) but after he arrives we move pretty quickly to opening gifts.

I feel sort of terrible about not having anything for Jeremy but it is a little late now. Especially feel bad when he gives me the best gift of Christmas, a vacuum siphon coffee pot! He says he remembers my telling him part of the reason I like [WTF Coffee Lab](http://wtfcoffeelaboratory.com/) in Fort Greene is because it felt like being back in a science lab. So he got me a science lab contraption capable of brewing coffee of my own!

Naturally we have to set it up and play with it, I mean brew with it, immediately. The instructions (yes, I read the instructions first) are somewhat confusing and the first brew goes poorly because I put the replacement filter on top of the actual filter which separated the coffee grounds from the water a little too well. Also the real filter wasn't hooked to the tube of the upper bowl so it looked like it wanted to float. The result was super weak coffee. After cleaning up we tried again, improving our process based on what we had learned (*you know, like scientists*) and the second brew was **way** better.

Now we are waiting for the lamb shanks to stew (?) in the crock pot. Super day.
