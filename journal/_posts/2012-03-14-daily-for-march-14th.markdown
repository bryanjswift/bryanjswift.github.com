I had a pretty late night last night. I'm not sure why but I couldn't get myself to feel tired. On the bright side I got to read a lot of the things I had stored in Readability. I'm down to about fifty unread articles. 

I had set an alarm for 10:00 but in the morning reset it to 10:30 which is when I actually roused myself from bed. I had a call with Jacob Nelson at 11:00 to discuss the hiring process and current projects at Google. It was certainly interesting talking to him about the process and to hear about how their teams are structured. We didn't talk too much about the position though he did send me some preparation materials to look at before the technical phone interview. The preparation materials are insightful because they highlight things I struggled with in previous interviews as well. 

This depressed me a bit because it is a lot of things that were important to learn to form a solid base understanding of computer science but they do not seem to be things which are necessarily applicable to everyday use. As a result the preparation feels a great deal like busy work or studying for an exam. None-the-less I did go out and buy some books relevant to the algorithms and data structures material specifically identified and I do plan to study back up on it whether I decide to go through with interviewing at Google or not because they are clearly things interviewers expect me to have a better understanding of than I do presently. 

One book I got is _Algorithms in a Nutshell_ and it seems like it will give me a pretty brief overview of a number of common algorithms and problem patterns. The other is _Introduction to Algorithms_ which is much more of a textbook than a refresher but it will provide a great deal more depth and after reading the Nutshell introduction I feel I may require the depth.
