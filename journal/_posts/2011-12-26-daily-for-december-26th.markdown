I woke up pretty promply at 09:00, but I couldn't tell you why. I went down and had some breakfast and brewed some coffee after reading a bit of the internet. I also braved up and downloaded the first couple of things I 'wanted' from the private tracker Darrell invited me too last night. This was the catalyst for my day really.

I wanted to download things from the tracker because it is in Freeleach which means I can download for free but my uploaded data will still count for my ratio.  So until the end of the year I can pad my numbers a bit to keep my ratio strong. I only need a 0.50 to keep out of hostile territory on the tracker but having a higher ratio has its privileges. This desire soon led me to discover I wasn't able to seed anything. The short version is I probably spent five hours trying to sort out why two different routers wouldn't let me seed on random ports before giving up just before dinner. Upon returning to my computer just after dinner I discovered I was once again able to seed. I'm pretty vague on what made the difference but at least it works.

Mai and Jer are leaving tomorrow morning and to get to LAX on time we need to leave pretty early in the morning. I'm sitting on the bed watching Mai pack and it is making me sad but I think it will be good to have a few days apart. Of course this means the no job and no apartment problems are quickly coming to a head. ___Fuck___.
