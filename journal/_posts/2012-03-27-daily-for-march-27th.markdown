Up early again for the running before work. I like the idea but I'm not sure how long I will be able to keep it up. Mai was up early today too because she had an interview at 08:30 uptown. I was in the office shortly before 09:00 and did some digging around in the code base before Rob got in and assigned me some tasks.

The back end for the application uses [Spring MVC](http://www.springsource.org/) which I find to be the most indirect and convoluted framework I've ever worked with. Nothing is in the Java source code it is all in XML files and the XML files all have special tile names for the information I want. So I have to find the tile name in the Java, find the tile definition in the XML and then find the JSP. It is all quite infuriating.

After work I went to the FedEx office to try and pick up the AppleTV that would have been delivered on Monday but they couldn't find it. On the way back to the apartment I called in a pizza order at [Lombardi's](http://firstpizza.com/). Shortly after placing my order I got a call from the lady at FedEx saying they found my package. So I will go back and get it tomorrow.

I worked up a quick and dirty estimate for Amanda on another site today. I'm hoping they don't want to go through with it because I'm already going to be under the gun for this project with Wondersauce competing for attention with HUGE.
