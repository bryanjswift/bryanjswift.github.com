I was up relatively early to go and see my father speak at a conference about glass put on by one of Amgen's glass suppliers. He was talking about the increasingly common expectation of zero defects from pharmaceutical companies and how it impacts the pharmaceutical manufacturers and why it is important for companies to be increasingly aware of what is happening across the entire supply chain, from suppliers of suppliers down to the end user.

It was an interesting talk not only because he's my dad and I don't really get to see hime in a professional environment strutting his stuff too often but also because it has obvious parallels to software development. People increasingly expect software to be defect free and in order for a developer to be able to accomplish the idealistic state she must be aware of what is happening from inside software libraries and even libraries used by libraries to how the software is being used by the audience.

After the talk my mom and I went to see St. Patrick's Cathedral and it was impressive. We went in through the entrance on the south side which diminished the initial impression but once we walked around and were standing in the entry way looking down the aisle towards the pulpit the view literally took my breath away. The scale of the place is immense and realizing it was all worked by hand because the machines and tools to automate the work did not exist yet makes it that much more extravagant. In addition to the sheer scale of the structure the sculpture and relief work in simply stunning.

Once my mom and I had finished marveling at the interior of the cathedral we took the train back to Spring St. and walked to my apartment where we sat and relaxed while waiting for Mai to return from her interview (which went well *fingers crossed*) so we could get some lunch and go to see the [Frick Collection](http://www.frick.org/). We had lunch at [Sauce](http://www.saucerestaurant.com/) which is just up the street from our apartment. The quality of the meal was outstanding and the prices were supremely reasonable (pasta dishes from ~ $7.00 USD).

Appetites sated we took the âž… train north to 68th St -- Hunter College and walked to the Frick Collection. The museum used to be where the Frick family lived which is crazy. The place takes up half a city block and faces Central Park and every room has its walls covered with beautiful paintings and old furniture. The collection was impressive but if I were going to go back to either the museum or the cathedral it would definitely be St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Following the collection we went to my parent's hotel room in the Waldorf and hung around out for a little while before Mai and I returned to the apartment, picking up our [new toaster oven from Crate & Barrel](http://www.crateandbarrel.com/kitchen-and-food/ovens/breville-smart-oven/s676792) on the way (thanks Mom). My mother thought it would be fun to buy us a toaster oven as a housewarming present, though she led me to believe it was to be my birthday gift.

Once Mai and I were home we picked up a grocery bag and headed to Whole Foods to get some supplies to make dinner. On the way Mai decided her hungry monster was a little too awake and she couldn't wait until we bought groceries and got home and cooked to eat so we stopped at [The Bowery Diner](http://bowerydiner.com/) for dinner before getting supplies.
