Today was the first day all week I actually felt productive at Huge. I don't know if it was the coffee in the morning that just had my brain and body in overdrive. I don't know if maybe I'm starting to finally understand how bits are put together. Maybe I'm just getting used to sitting and focusing for longer periods of time again. Whatever it is I'm grateful.

I also got a call today from the Google recruiter saying Saul thought I wasn't Google material. I don't blame him, I don't think I am either.

I tried to run home from Huge with my ruck on my back. The ruck was heavy but didn't move around too much so I don't think it was bothering me. My foot though was bothering me quite a bit. By the time I hit the Manhattan bridge entrance I could feel it swelling up and pushing against my shoe. I tried to push through the pain but ultimately had to stop several times. It still hurts now but hopefully it won't hurt much by tomorrow.

I spent a little time at Huge sketching and doodling. One of the doodles I liked the look of and so I think I may try and make it into my logo. I have spent the last two hours or so trying to render the paths the way I sketched them using SVG. They are getting close so maybe I can do it. I also sketched it out in the [Paper iPad app](http://www.fiftythree.com/).
