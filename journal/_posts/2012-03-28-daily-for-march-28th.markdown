I'm already frustrated with work. I was supremely spoiled by not having to keep normal hours and now that I do again it is quite difficult. It doesn't help that the desk I am using isn't 'mine' and so I don't want to adjust the chair and so I am uncomfortable for the time I am there. Also the system is built in a crazy indirect way and so finding things takes a while. Also the local dev environment is dependent on shared CMS resources (or something) which go down periodically as people redeploy. Additionally the webservices calls which need to happen upon application restart take a long time. All of this adds up to a super frustrating develpment environment. Strangely no one else seems to be bothered by it. Either that or they have already tried and failed to fight this battle.

Ugh.
