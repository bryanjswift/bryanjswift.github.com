Mai and I have tentatively started looking for a place. There seem to be plenty of places available even though it is the start of the month and as usual the turn around times are expected to be in hours. I sent a couple of emails to people asking about places and quickly got replies along the lines of "why don't you come by this afternoon". This is super frustrating for me because I can't in any way be there.

In any case I think we'll be able to find a decent place but I'm going to need a place to stay for a couple of days while we look. Time to start asking friends about couches to surf I guess.

I still don't have any kind of work lined up and I think this bothers me a lot more than the no living quarters does because I know how long some projects can take to get started.
