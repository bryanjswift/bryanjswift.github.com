Today was laundry day. Mai and I collected our bags of laundry and took them to the laundromat. While waiting for our clothes to wash we walked around the neighborhood some, mostly exploring Stanton and Rivington Streets between Eldrige and Suffolk. It was a nice little walk and now we both have clean panties again.

I also spent a couple hours today writing follow-up emails and taking phone calls and responding to emails about work. I spoke with Tara at Solomon Page Group about some HTML email work she had for JWT. However, they were not looking to pay much more than $50 / hour and I wasn't willing to take such a deep pay cut. I also replied to Jacob Nelson at Google, we have a call scheduled for tomorrow at 11:00 to talk some more. Additionally I applied for a Archival Web Developer position at the New York Public Library, the job sounds like it is a temporary role to create a prototype for how to better store and search data in the library system, and it sounds kind of awesome.

We went to San Loco on 2nd Avenue for dinner. We both had burritos and they were pretty good though I feel like I ate about a pound of fat and it is just spreading itself around my gut.

Prior to dinner I went for a run despite the pain in my left knee and it turned out to be a good run. I went a little over 5k at a pace of just over six minutes per kilometer. On top of the pace my heart rate stayed pretty low for the first four kilometers hovering around 153 beats per minute. *Mai says hi*.
