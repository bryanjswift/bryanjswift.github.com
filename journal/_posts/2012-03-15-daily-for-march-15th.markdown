I slept in a little later than I have been lately and while I don't mind it for a day or two I am hoping to not make a habit of it. On the other hand I didn't do much with my day other than read a lot of things on the internet. I did sign up for a new [TV streaming service](http://aereo.com) for which I had signed up for an invite. Mostly I signed up for it because it would make Mai happy since there are lots of things I don't watch that she would like to. While the service seems pretty outstanding thus far the number of channels seems to be limited mostly to large national networks. FX, USA and TNT are not offered on the service which are the ones I know Mai would watch a lot of.

I didn't hear back from anyone besides [ZocDoc](http://www.zocdoc.com) regarding work today which is somewhat upsetting. ZocDoc seems like an interestin place and they are doing good society helping work but it is `C#` which I don't love, what it being a Microsoft technology and meaning I would almost certainly need to be developing on a Windows machine.

I spent a little bit of time this morning talking with Dana over Facebook Messenger about what was going on with work for both of us. The conversation really started because I sent her a message last night about me making Mai send her a friend request.

Despite my knee still hurting Mai and I went for a jog this afternoon. We kept the pace pretty easygoing at about seven and a half minutes per kilomenter. We jogged for a little more than thirty-three minutes and most of the time my knee felt fine until right at the end when I decided to push and sprinted for two blocks. As soon as I took my first stride I knew I was in trouble because just stretching it out hurt. None-the-less I ran the whole two blocks and was out of breath at the end of it but it was nice to stretch it out.

After showering and having a snack Mai and I went to meet my Mom for dinner. We went to [Soba Totto](http://sobatotto.com). Mom and I had soba and Mai had yakitori, everything was quite good and the clientele was almost entirely Japanese business men which I think says a lot about the food quality.
