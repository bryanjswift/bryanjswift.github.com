The old saying "when it rains, it pours" may be holding true for me as of today (I don't want to jinx it or anything). I got an above rate offer from HUGE this afternoon and just before getting the offer I had a good meeting with two of the guys behind Wondersauce. In the meeting I mentioned I may be working on-site for a contract and so wouldn't be able to be on-site at Wondersauce and they didn't seem to care which is great. Working two gigs is certainly the fastest way I can think of to build the reserves back up.

All in all today has been a pretty good day even though I didn't have to move around much from the comfort of the apartment.

I'm incredibly relieved to have steady work again. Assuming the paperwork comes through as expected I will be starting starting at HUGE on Monday, March 26th and working with them through the first full week of June. The relief stems from the tightly controlled panic I was beginning to have welling up whenever I had to look at my finances. They are in much worse shape than they have been for a long time.

In addition to the work from Wondersauce and HUGE I may also be picking up some work from [Brian Jeremy](twitter.com/brianjeremy). He's at [Tribal DDB](http://tribalddb.com/) as a Director of Technology in the San Francisco office and I'm relatively certain the work would be coming through them. The work sounds like it is PHP cleanup and some additional front-end updating. I haven't heard back from him since sending the first barrage of feeler questions though so we shall see how it pans out.
