Managed to run the 10k in a little over an hour which surprised me. Mostly because I didn't have to stop and I thought I would. Henry finished in about forty-five minutes which is kind of impressive. Mai was a cheater though and walked less than halfway before turning around to wait for me at the start. 

After the Run for Japan we got some second breakfast and headed home where Mai promptly fell asleep and I started to catch up on my Readability reading list. 

Once Mai woke up around 14:45 we went to get some groceries before meeting Henry for dinner at Otafuku.
