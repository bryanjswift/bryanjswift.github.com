Woke up later today which means I didn't go running again. Working at HUGE was less frustrating today. I think I'm getting used to the developer friction there and apparently the client is happy with the architecture work and the code that has been developed by the team and that is what really matters at the end of the day. 

I bailed around 10:45 to go be interviewed over the phone for a position at Google. The interview went fairly well. There was one question I didn't know how to answer. He asked about how TCP or HTTP requests were created by a system and I could go much lower level than a "use this library" type answer. I also had a small snafu with the wireless at Starbucks. It seemed to intermittently drop the connection. 

Despite leaving for the interview I still walked out of the office around 18:00 and was home around 18:40. I wanted to set up my Apple TV but it doesn't come packaged with an HDMI cable so that was a non-starter. After we ate (leftover pizza from Lombardi's) Mai and I  spent some time going back and forth on Draw Something. In between my turns I was reading the internet. I found some interesting things but sent most of them to Instapaper to read later.

As of right now I'm looking forward to starting on or getting back to a personal project or another freelance gig. I don't know why but I really want to have something else to work on. Perhaps it is because I am so dissatisfied with the development I am doing during the day. 

I also found a couple of things which are exciting. [Sytpi](http://www.stypi.com) which is a collaborative editing thing online which records keystrokes is kind of what I've been thinking about how I'd like to publish blog posts and stories. Show the finished product but also show the act of creation. There is also [Paper](http://fiftythree.com/) for the iPad which makes me want to draw. A lot. The app is beautiful and the demo makes it look like the gratest thing ever. I also enjoyed [Shawn Blanc's Diary of an iPad Owner](http://shawnblanc.net/2012/03/diary-of-an-ipad-3-owner/) which made me want the new iPad. Retina Display!

Soon all the world will be mine. Or at least the new Apple gadgets I want.
