We saw a ton of apartments today. We started off meeting with Ivan from [Anchor](http://www.anchornyc.com/) who is super nice. He showed us eight apartments which boiled down to two apartment in a couple different layouts. The last place he showed us was one of mine and Mai's favorites. It is a studio technically but what we would make the bed area is slightly elevated and with curtains or screens can be well separated from the rest of the apartment (24th & Park).

Next we met with Penny to see a couple of places in the Lower East Side. Both were one bedrooms, the first is in an elevator building near the intersection of Clinton & Stanton. It was a really attractive and well maintained apartment though slightly smaller than the studio Ivan showed us. The second was near Allen & Houston, in a walk-up on the fifth floor and was obviously not as well maintained.

Then we took a cab across town and met with James, who is quite pretty, to see a place at Christopher & Gay in the West Village. The neighborhood is wonderful but the apartment itself was, for us, unlivalbly small.

Once we were done being disappointed by the place in the West Village we met Ami for lunch at [Ippudo NY](http://www.ippudony.com/) for ramen and it was *delicious*. Mai and I talked about our trip and the apartment hunt. Ami told us about her recent vacation with Kai and quitting her job (yay). Then we conversed for a while about where she is thinking about going next and what she would be doing. After lunch we went and got cookies and a cupcake at [Crumbs](www.crumbs.com/) all were amazing and it was great seeing Ami.

Mai and I then walked back down University Place and got tea at Argo Tea while I had a quick phone call with David Garfinkel from [Knewton](http://knewton.com) which is an adaptive e-learning platform. We agreed to touch base early next week after things, hopefully, settle down with the apartment hunt.

Post phone call we took the train to Carroll Gardens to meet with David Atteratta from [Brownstone Realty](http://brownstonelistings.com). He showed us two places. The first was a good sized two bedroom with a giant kitchen which I immediately fell in love with. It is in an apartment building on Union St between Court and Smith. The second was a one bedroom on 2nd Place between Clinton and Henry. It was in a brownstone and laid out similarly to the place I had on 4th Place and Henry a couple of years ago. It was nice enough and Mai fell in love with the giant walk in closet but I didn't love it and the kitchen felt cheaply done, especially after the giant new kitchen in the place on Union.

Afterward we went back into Gramercy to meet with Ivan again to try and see a place in 141 E 26th St. (near Lexington) but we weren't able to get in despite waiting around for the landlord / super for a while.

Then the debate started. Mai and I have been discussing for a while which apartment we liked best and (so far) have it narrowed down to the last place Ivan showed us on 24th & Park ($2700) and the first place David showed us on Union between Court and Smith ($2600). I like the idea of an extra room and a real bedroom and a huge kitchen (Carroll Gardens). She thinks the 'master' bedroom is too small to comfortably fit the bed we want and believes it is silly for us to have a lot of space if the bedroom feels cramped and I can understand where she is coming from. She feels as though she isn't really living in New York if it isn't in Manhattan and is completely in love with the foyer in the studio. I don't not having space to separate work or the size of the kitchen (in comparison).

Realistically though the place in Gramercy is probably better because I won't be tempted to stay home and work all the time because I'd get all stir crazy. And the work I seem to be getting put in for is largely contract work which involves me being on site rather than spending a lot of time in a home office. Additionally I'm too fixated on the kitchen which, practically speaking is much larger than we need it to be. Lastly Gramercy is much closer to my likely work locations and it has more diverse subway access. I think we are going to try and see it again tomorrow to take some better pictures and get a better feel for the dimensions of the apartment.
