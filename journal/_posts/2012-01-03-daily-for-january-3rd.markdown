My dad took Pearl to the vet early this morning and we discovered the slight limp Mai and I had noticed when running with her was actually knee ligament damage in the dog equivalent of her ACL. She went to the vet because last night she tried to turn sharply in the mulch and immediately picked it up after hurting it worse. Poor girl.

I tried to go for a long run today shortly after waking up but at about the 5.3 km mark I got dizzy and wobbly and had to stop. I think (and hope) I just wasn't well hydrated enough because I had only had a half glass of water before going.

[Readability tweeted about Persnicketly](https://twitter.com/readability/status/154303466523734016) and drove just over 500 new page views of [Persnicketly](http://persnicketly.com). Some of those folks approved us to read their data and so we have some more users now. The best part about it is this influx of traffic makes me want to make some of the updates I've been thinking about to Persnicketly whereas before I'd been considering changes but had no motivation to act on them. With a little luck I can keep my interest up while I hunt for a gig.

Mom also got her sling off today and seems happier already. She starts physical therapy tomorrow.
