Hi secret public journal. Been a while. I find myself wondering how much I'll
feel comfortable putting in here versus feeling like I need to censor myself
but trying to write it is really the only way to find out. "Catching you up"
probably isn't a good idea, after all it has been almost seven years and that's
a lot to catch up on.

Mai and I finished up our road trip to see my parents, they live in Texas as of
this year. They built their house and it feels like their old house but...
bigger. Which, being Texas, fits well.

My parents dog (Kona) and our dog (Tankerbell, we have a dog now) are not
getting on well. Kona doesn't like other dogs much Tank has been great about
getting barked and growled at by Kona.

I've been opening up the time capsule that is the source for this site while
getting it re-organized. Interesting to read what was in my head so long ago.
