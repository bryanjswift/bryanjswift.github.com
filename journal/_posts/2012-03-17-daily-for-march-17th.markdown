Happy St. Paddy's Day! Mai and I got up a little late (around 11:00), just before I got a text from Amy Heishman confirming our lunch plans at 13:00. Once awake I decided we should go for a quick jog before lunch.

We only jogged for about twenty-five minutes and then had to hustle through a shower and getting dressed to make it to [An Choi](http://anchoinyc.com/) in time. We almost made it.

We had lunch with Amy's friend Jamie and her "squeeze" Chris. It was fun, the conversation was continuous. I had forgotten how much I enjoy speaking with her. And of course she reminded me and told everyone that the last time we hung out was in fact the day before the first time I went down to see Mai. Amy was excited to meet the girl I was so nervous to go see the last time, and almost two years later.

Mai and I didn't do much after lunch at An Choi. I read some words on my iPad. Mai went and had coffee with the younger sister of Patrick ("Peach"), Mary. Then we watched some bad TV.
