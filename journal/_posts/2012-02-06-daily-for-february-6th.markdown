I've been such a slacker with this lately. I haven't written any journaling for several days. I don't have any good reasons or excuses, I've had the time just not the inclination. Mai and I have been working on the apartment and, as Ami said on Path, nesting. The apartment is still a mess of things and boxes and broken down boxes but there are decidedly fewer boxes strewn about and the boxes that are still stacked have fewer things in them. We are still missing some essential cooking equipment because it is in my kitchen box we decided to leave in storage because I only thought about my ugly flower plates in it rather than pots and pans and other utensils.

I still have no work. I have been trying to get a hold of Darrell because I'm actually interested in entertaining his job offer and the guy won't return my texts. Essentially I've decided to hear more about the job and see how much money they are willing to give me. If they can match what I can make freelancing and the work doesn't sound terrible I'm willing to take it. At this point I would rather have the security than continue doing freelance work. At the same time the idea of not being freelance and giving up the freedoms associated with the lifestyle do cause a visceral and unpleasant reaction in my brain. I think it is the sacrifice of autonomy I have to make in order to be an employee again. 

On the other hand I have almost no leads for work except for other full-time positions and work with advertising firms. Specifically, Cheil USA working for Kaare. I made a stink before about working for him rather than with him but I am over the mentality caused by the breakdown. He trusts me and I trust him and while I know I don't want to work for him full-time because I don't agree with or think I would flourish under his management style I do not have a problem doing freelance work for him.

My other employment prospects seem to be non-existent at this time though and that simple statement of fact has been supremely depressing for me to come to terms with. I had been operating under the assumption I could find work again whenever I wanted it and the reality has simply not lived up to the expectation. I think I need to spend some time actively hunting for work and contacting people to see if they hear of anything but even the hunt can take a little while to turn something up when I pursue in this manner. I am not totally freaking out yet but I am pretty close.

I have rarely if ever been so stressed over money and I'm not anywhere near dire straits yet. None-the-less I do not like it one bit. I tried to talk to Mai about how stressful this has become for me and she played it down providing platitudes. She may be right and everything will probably work out fine but it was frustrating and a little patronizing to hear from her.

I'm exhausted, I need to go to bed. Good night journal.

I finally ordered internet today from Time Warner Cable. I ordered their fastest plan which will supposedly get me 50 Mbps / 15 Mbps (down / up). We will see about that. 

I also went to the freelancer support group tonight organized by Lynn. She and I were the only two people there. We talked for a while about some of the problems we have had freelancing and taking our business to the next level. It seems like we both have trouble generating good leads and even when we have them out personalities conflict with us doing good follow up with the leads.
