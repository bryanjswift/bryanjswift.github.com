Mai and I were supposed to start our apartment hunt this morning around 11 AM in Gramercy but the guy (Louis I think) had to cancel because the apartments he wanted to show us were still having work done and had wet floors. So we went to get my brown A. Testoni shoes from storage along with some other things I wanted for my interview after we got a bagel from Bagel World (so delicious).

Then we went and parked by the place we were going to see later in Prospect Heights. The broker for Prospect Heights (Mia) couldn't meet us earlier so we just walked around the neighborhood for a while and then walked through Park Slope on the way to the F stop at 4th & 9th.

The interview with Gilt Groupe went well but it seemed overly corporate and somewhat bureaucratic. I do not want to be in a position where I have several different bosses and am siloed into doing just one thing. The guy from the front end team did make it sound like they touched more than just the front end code but it just didn't feel right.

Then Mai and I went to see the apartment in Prospect Heights. It was big and attractive but the bathroom is separate from the apartment. So we would have to leave the apartment to go pee or shower and that just isn't ok.

Then we went to [Franny's](http://www.frannysbrooklyn.com/) for dinner and got delicious pizza and took some to Mehera at Miami Ad School. After chatting with her for a while we came back here so I could try and fix the internet. I can't take much credit but I did learn something new about cable modems, if they aren't connecting to the router leave them unplugged for over 60 seconds so the capacitors completely discharge. The amount of time does indeed matter.
