After we got up this morning Mai started calling apartmens. She first called the place in SoHo and left a message. After SoHo she called about the place on Forsyth and Delancey, Nir from the management company answered and asked how soon we could be there because he was in the area and could show it right away. This was around 09:10. She told him we were in Dumbo and I told her to tell him we could be there in 30 minutes. So instead of going out to get breakfast we got our shit together and trudged out into the rain to see this apartment.

The apartment was in the process of being renovated so the floors were all torn up and the fixtures were kind of a mess but the apartment is pretty good size for the price they are asking ($1900) particularly the bedroom. The living area is a certainly on the small side but probably liveable. We told Nir and David (the "broker") we wanted to talk about it but would be in touch shortly.

We headed to yet another Starbucks to deliberate. Mai really likes the apartment but I'm not in love with it. To be honest though I think she likes it in part because the price is a lot lower than what we were looking at and she's as sick of looking as I started out being. We briefly decide to continue to look but the list of apartments only continues one other real prospect in Manhattan. She calls the guy about a place in Gramercy and he tells us it has already been rented. The rest of the 'interested in' apartments are in Brooklyn and I know she doesn't really want to be in Brooklyn so we make the call to say we're interested. They send over the paperwork, we go to FedEx, print it, fill it out and fax it over. Done by 11:45.

And then the waiting begins.We end up walking all over the damn place. We did end up going to see Darrell at [co:](http://www.cocollective.com). I wanted to talk to him and see what the new gig was all about, plus I know he's always good for a job offer. I got in touch with [Gavin](http://twitter.com/grokstar) about [Bondsy](http://bondsy.com) and we've exchanged a couple emails. We went to Uni Qlo and got some jeans to send to Jer. Mostly though we cruised around the city on foot waiting for something to happen.

Around 16:00 we got kind of sick of waiting and the nervous feeling in my stomach was telling me 'we might be getting scammed here'. So I asked Mai to call the broker and find out what was up. After some texts and phone calls exchanged we found out from Nir the application looked good and he (as a representative of the management company) thought things looked good but the building owner was the one who had to actually approve us and they hadn't been able to get in touch with him. So we are spending yet another night in Mehera's apartment but we will hopefully have it all sorted out as of tomorrow.

Of course I also just realized this means I haven't been running in nearly a week, though we have been walking a lot so hopefully that makes up for things a bit.
