Even more frustrated today than I was yesterday by things at Huge. I spent some time exchanging IMs with the project manager trying to figure out why we couldn't cut a page for the benefit of the user experience and to ave some time. The PM gave me no answer at all. At the end of the day I got an answer from the tech lead but it was along the lines of because the client expects this section to be exactly the same. This is a poor answer in my opinion, it makes it seem like parts weren't planned for in the beginning and now it is impossible to go back and renegotiate with the client. Of course I only have a few parts of the story since I came in at the end of the project so possibly this was a conscious and informed decision and correct decision. Whether it was or not I still feel like I'm being asked to do busy work because it is implementing "features" no one seeks to want (from what I can gather from the business analyst) but we are contractually obligated to implement anyway. 

After work at Huge I had a kickoff phone call with the guys at Wondersauce to talk a but about the project I'll be doing for them and get on the same starting page. Hopefully I will have creative from them tomorrow but to be honest not having it isn't holding me back yet.

After Walking home and eating dinner I put some work in on the Wondersauce project. As a result I learned about creating custom Perch apps but I'm not sure I will be able to use the app to create the kind of interaction I want. And even if I can I am not sure it is worth the time investment.
