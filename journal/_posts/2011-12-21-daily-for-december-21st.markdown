*H.O.L.Y. F.U.C.K.* For the first time since we left for Japan I'm in pain. It isn't the terrible gut-wrenching kind but it isn't pleasant. I noticed it starting last night with my right heel but  now it is involved about halfway up my calf, at least I can feel it pulsing that far up my leg. I'm pretty confident it is gout and not some aftershock of my running a couple days ago because I haven't taken my medication in approximately three days so it has probably had plenty of time to clear my system. And since I'm still at my parent's house I'm eating super rich foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food and the lack of medication are coming together to form a circle of hurt.

Mai and I got up early to decorate the tree and put presents under it after my parents left for my mom's surgery. Mai thought it would be a nice 'welcome home' surprise. She's right but decorating for the holidays has never been fun for me it always feels like a chore.

The last of the presents are wrapped and under the tree, they arrived just a few hours ago. I still don't have anything for my brother though.

The foot/heel pain has steadily but slowly gone down throughout the day. Hopefully taking the drugs again tomorrow will mostly back it off. I did end up taking a couple of Aleve to assist with pain management.
