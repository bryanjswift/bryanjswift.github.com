I was up at a reasonalbe time today but I didn't do much with my morning besides eat breakfast and read some of the internet before getting ready for my interview at [HUGE](http://www.hugeinc.com) scheduled for 12:30. 

I made it to the interview just a touch ahead of schedule and sat for a little while checking out their office and watching the people. Nothing really jumped out at me watching people, it reminded me of being at AKQA. I met with the two Principal Web Developers (more senior than senior) and we talked about some of the things I've worked on most recently as well as a couple of 'trick' questions. The trick questions weren't actually tricks though, more edge cases testing knowledge of odd JavaScript behavior. I talked more about CSS with the first guy (Karl) and more about JavaScript with the second guy (Stan). After getting put through my paces a bit the recruiters came in and we shot the shit for a little while. Ostensibly they were there to answer questions I had and talk to me about next steps but we talked for about twenty-five minutes beyond the time necessary for the information exchange.

After interviewing I stopped by [Miami Ad School](http://www.miamiadschool.com/advertising-school/new-york) to see Mehera. We talked for a little while about what is going on with her and where I am with looking for work. It's her life I don't want to go publicizing it here but it was great to see her and we took Siri for a little walk to the dog park.

After chatting for a bit we started to head back and I got the call I was expecting from [ZocDoc](http://www.zocdoc.com/). I talked to Curtis Smith for a little while about what ZocDoc is looking for in an engineer, how big there team is, am I interested. General feeler out questions on both ends. The initial talk was interesting but knowing they are a Windows shop is a definite turn off for me and I can't seem to shake it.

Once I finished talking to Curtis I walked home to get some dinner. Not much interesting to report on that front, or the happenings after dinner save one. [Aziz Ansari](http://azizansari.com/) released a new comedy special the [same way Louis CK did](http://bryanwrit.es/here/2011/louis-ck-special-money/) and I was so excited about the perpetuation of this policy I bought it (for five dollars!). After downloading it Mai and I watched it. Oh also I bought tickets to see him at the Beacon Theatre on June 16th. Hooray!
