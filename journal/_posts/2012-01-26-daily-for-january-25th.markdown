I got to sleep in a bit today because Mai was wonderful and got up without me to get Kai off to school. However when I got up around 09:30 she was having none of it and ended up sleeping until almost 11:00. This frustrated me a lot because she is always a pain in the ass to get out of bed. I hope this changes when she has work otherwise it might drive me bonkers. 

While Mai was sleeping I did some more work on Persnicketly. Specifically I worked on a page showing only the last seven days worth of bookmarks. I also improved a couple of abstractions to make maintenance easier.

After working on Persnicketly I started thinking about what I'm actually going to do about work. I started making a mind map of ideas and leads. Unfortunately most of my ideas and leads are for full time positions and I am not in love with the idea of full time work. 

While I was working on the jobs ideas Kai got home from school. He wanted to play Magic some more but because I was working he let me do it. He did seem a little surprised I didn't have a job though. 

Around 1735 I left to meet Rachel Diesel at the Brooklyneer on Houston St. It was incredibly easy to get there from Ami's place, take the 1 for five stops. She was a little late but not by much. She started off by asking about the trip and so I told her. We talked about the travels Mai and I had for a little while before we dove into work ideas. 

I talked with her about my idea for the crime data research tool and she was into it. So both Ami and Rachel dig the idea and think it has merit so I think it is definitely something I should act on. She also had a work related proposition for me. She thinks several of us should either start a company or just start working on things together. The 'us' in question consists of myself, herself, Abbey Bridges, Ami, Alex Nguyen and Rachel's friend Brett. They (presumably Rachel, Abbey and Brett) have a couple of ideas they are kicking around but none are quite fully baked yet. The two Diesel talked about were a time/resource management tool for businesses and a recipe collection site. 

I read something not long ago deriding people for creating recipe sites instead of things that matter and solve problems because of the challenges involved in simply getting started on solving harder problems. When she mentioned a recipe aggregation platform this is all I could think of. The time and resource management software on the other hand is something I think is worth investing in. Not to mention it is a problem which had previously taken up headspace for me anyway because of the resource manager / timesheet tool I had started several years back. I also see timesheets and resource management as a product solving a real problem and so could have a product business model which is something I am definitely looking for in startup type work. I feel like a recipe site based on user content requires a larger audience to be useful and so is much more difficult to bootstrap. Not to mention it makes it about a thousand times more likely we end up selling ad space or user data rather than whatever we are building. I want to create a product not a clever data collection tool for advertisers. 

Diesel and I talked a little more about startups and business but not much before taking off. Mai and Kai were still eating when I got home so Mai made me dinner. After dinner Kai was being ornery about his math homework so I made a point of helping him out with it. He's a bright kid but seems really disinterested in the math homework. 

We made a little deal to stay up 30 minutes later in order to get the homework done. It was already 20:00 and he had been out with Mai to try and pick up the homework he left at school and to walk the dog do hadn't had much 'play' time. With that deal made he plowed right through the work, and he might have heard Mai and I talking about no Krispy Treats if he didn't finish his homework. Technically it isn't done but after the first fraction adding sheet I drew the angles of the second sheet while he walked Beta so he could label them in the morning. 

Once he was in bed Mai watched Top Chef: Texas on the TV and I went in to the bedroom and watched Justified, House of Lies and Californication on my computer. 

Then Mai and I talked a bit and now bed time. Yay journaling.
