Mai and Jeremy both left today. I drove them both to LAX and left them with their baggage on the curb. They both arrived safely at their destinations. For the first time since late August I am without a constant companion and rather than free I feel lonely. In many respects this is a good thing though I mourn my bachelor spirit, if I had it.

I received an email from Ryan at Simple today who put me in touch with [James Podzena](http://twitter.com/jpoz) to set up a third interview. Then if they want to move forward it means a trip to Portland to meet folks.

I've been thinking a fair amount about the interview I have scheduled with Gilt on the ninth and the application form they want me to fill out. I need to take a look at it again but I think it is too much information and I am not sure I am willing to move forward with it.

Most of the rest of the day was spent [researching rtorrent](/blog/2011/rtorrent-documentation) and setting up a functioning configuration file. Part of getting rtorrent up and running was to take better advantage of the current [free leech](http://wiki.bakabt.me/index.php/FAQ#What_is_Freeleech.3F) period to pad my ratio.

It actually seems like the ratio will hard to maintain because there are a couple of folks who are seeding heavily which means even a popular torrent I'm not able to push data up fast enough to matter.
