I started doing some more work and research for the Wondersauce project. The [Perch's FoxyCart shop app](http://grabaperch.com/add-ons/apps/shop-foxycart) may solve some of my product management product category design problems. Which would be great. I think it will handle individual product pages as well as category or collection pages.

I also did a little (tiny) bit more reading in one of the algorithms books. I'm so going to bomb this interview with Google.

Even better I got a couple of emails from Britt at Highline games about some server side work they are looking to have done. I'm going to need to look at it and see if it is something I can do quickly. If it is I may try and get it done super fast in order to help maintain the relationship but if not I may just have to tell him I'm too busy now to get it done. I think that would be a real shame since I spent so much time developing the lead but at the same time I've been after him for work for about two months and he's only now sent me some.

Mai worked on the bathroom today, so no showers until Monday. Hopefully things are drying properly. While Mai was working in the bathroom I went to the store to get some supplies to take to Mehera's for grilling. We ended up taking a couple of tuna steaks and some Chilean sea bass as well as some crab stuffed portabello mushrooms. All things were delicious and the company and conversation, though heavy on the feminism, we lovely.
