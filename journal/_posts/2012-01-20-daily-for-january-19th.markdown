I'm tired and I don't know what to write today. I did some work on Persnicketly from Starbucks again while Mai filed paperwork for the Tax/Pelton family. I am pretty sure I have the groundwork for the Persnicketly RSS feed laid but there is still work to do.

We went to see the [new(-ish) Sherlock Holmes movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1515091/). I enjoyed it though I thought the first one was better. I suspect I feel as I do in large part because I thought the first one was told in an interesting and original way and of course the second one was similarly done to the first so it couldn't be as original. Obviously. It was none-the-less quite enjoyable.

The previews for the movie reminded me to look for [House of Lies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1797404/) and download it. So I did and watched the two available episodes when we got back. I'm not sure if it designed to be funny. But I'm amused by it while at the same forced to think about the big gender issues it casually includes with Marty Kaan's (Don Cheadle) son. Not to mention the obvious morality issues posed by Kaan's modus operandi.

Afterward I got to reading about how Hollywood and big media have gone a little nuclear on the Obama administration by doing their best to take their money and go home due to Obama's response to the SOPA/PIPA legislation. I think this is a big problem and so with words on the internet Obama has taken steps to protect hopefully we can get him some of that money back.
