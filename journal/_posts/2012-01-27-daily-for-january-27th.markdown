The weather today is pretty crummy, cool and pouring rain. As a result Mai and I have spent the morning sitting and reading. Though I did catch Beta about to pee on his "pee pad" in the corner and so we got him outside to pee instead. 

We have to go and get groceries today for dinner tonight but other than that we are pretty like to laze about today.

Totally got kicked out of the Whole Foods for bringing Beta inside. Even in his doggy bag it isn't ok. At least the lady was nice about it.

After the groceries Mai and I came back and I did some work on Persnicketly trying to think through the article read flow. The thinking and planning continued even after Kai came home and started playing his game, Little Big Planet. Kai played until dinner but I quit and started reading things in my Instapaper queue. 

Speaking of Instapaper, I applied for access to the full API and got approved. So after the reading on Persnicketly I would like to add support for pulling data from Instapaper. 

After dinner Kai and I played Kingdom Rush for a while. The game gets far more interesting than I gave it credit for after the first couple of levels. So even though I have seen some of the content now I am looking forward to playing it on my own. 

Best of all Beta hasn't peed or pooped in the apartment at all today.
