Mai and I woke up to my mom watching *Glee* really loud on her Nook. Journey's *Don't Stop Believin'* performed by the *Glee* cast is not and likely never will be my favorite way to wake up. The pain in my foot/heel is far more manageable today. It still hurts but not nearly as much.

I had my second interview with [Simple](http://simple.com) today with Ryan Snyder who is the project lead. He described his job as making sure everyone stayed focused on getting the project to mark. So basically his job is to be Seth Godin for simple, keep the focus on shipping. I thought the interview went reasonably wel. Though I rambled like I'd never been interviewed before I hope it came across as nervousness and enthusiasm for the company, because it was. I should hear today or tomorrow whether they intend to move forward or not. If they do want to move forward the next step would be travelling to Portland to meet the team and an in person interview. I'm all butterflies.

I bought a new domain for my writing, <bryanwrit.es>. Hopefully I can make the name a truism.
