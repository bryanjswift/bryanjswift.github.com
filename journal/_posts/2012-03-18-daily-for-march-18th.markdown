Wok up late again today. I don't like that I am finding myself easily sleeping in until 11:00. I think the best way to fix this will be to go to bed earlier, so we are going to try that starting tonight.

After getting up and eating some breakfast and reading the internet for a while Mai and I went for a jog. It wasn't a long jog, we went across the Manhattan bridge and back but I feel like I ran at a good pace though I did have to push myself to it. After we got back from the jog we had some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, un-toasted, while the new toaster oven burned off the chemicals inside it. Then we had to rush our shower because we were running late to meet my parents for bowling.

The thing was, the whole meet my parents for bowling was a ruse. Mai had planned a surprise birthday party despite it being over a month before my birthday. The best part is, on the way to [Brooklyn Bowl](http://www.brooklynbowl.com/), Alex texted me saying he couldn't make dinner for my birthday and I responded that he had the wrong person or the wrong day. The text from Alex didn't even make me suspicious. And when we walked in there was someone standing near my parents having a beer, I thought to myself "That looks a lot like Jeremy, but it can't be". In fact I was so focused on this person that couldn't be Jeremy I failed to notice the table full of my friends sitting next to my parents who were at the bar until they yelled "*SURPRISE!*".

I was blown away because I hadn't suspected a thing. Mary Lee, Rachel Diesel, Amanda Schultz, Ami and Kai Moore were all there. Most of my favorite ladies, including Mai and my mother. Apparently Mai had been secretly planning this for a month along with my mother and brother and I never even caught a whiff of it. Altogether I think it might be the sweetest thing anyone has done for me, trying to get all of my friends together to surprise me for my birthday, even if it was a month in advance. I'd like to believe it being pre-mature was part of why I was so clueless but truthfully I doubt it would have made a difference. 

The lot of us bowled for a while and then there were cupcakes and mom gave me a book of some of her favorite pictures from when I was a little one up until now and had everyone sign it. The whole thing was fucking awesome. Even better was finding out the lengths Mai went to trying to get even more people coordinated. She had a list of some twenty-five people she invited by raiding my phone and my Facebook for contact information. Being St. Paddy's weekend a lot of folks couldn't make it for various reasons but I don't even care. People I love came and celebrated my soon to be thirtieth birthday with me and Mai put in a ton of effort to make it happen and she is so clearly pleased with herself. The whole effort and occaision makes me glow with happiness, which is great because I was definitely falling into a funk again. And how could I now?

After the bowling party Jer and Mai and I made plans to get lunch tomorrow before he flies out which would be stellar. It would be so good to talk to the fucker. Talking via text messages isn't the same as sitting in the same place together when someone has been a daily part of your life for the last five years.

After the planning Mai and I headed home where we wrote some thank you notes and made some mini raviolis and had some dinner and watched some TV.
