Lazy day today. I did some work on the Wondersauce project even though I don't have a signed contract yet. It was mostly research work but it is still 'billable'. I'm trying to track hours to see how near or far my estimate was.

I think the product management will be ok. I will need to make some modifications to the Perch Shop app and possibly to the stock application but I've tagged the stock version so if I need to upgrade Perch I think I will be able to safely reapply the changes I made.

Other than some small bit of work on Wondersauce and answering some emails I didn't do much today. It was kind of nice honestly.
