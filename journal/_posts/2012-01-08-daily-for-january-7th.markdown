I got the keys I had left in California today (thanks Mom). I heard the oddly soothing doorbell around 10:50 and once I processed what it was I got up to get the door. Fortunately Dave was here and answered, giving me the package as I started down the stairs.

Once we got up Mai and I went for a run. She went for a short one, turning back after about a kilometer (she'd been working out hard at the climbing gym). I managed to go a little over 6.1 km in approximately 42 minutes. I feel pretty decent about the pace especially considering the number of long grades involved.

Then we went and had lunch with Kaitlyn and her husband Jason at Pork Belly BBQ in Del Ray. It reminded me of Hill Country BBQ and made me want to go there and stuff my face. Afterwards we came back and I worked some on Persnicketly while she emailed and called brokers about apartments. We have our schedule pretty well lined up for Monday and Tuesday apartment seeing.
