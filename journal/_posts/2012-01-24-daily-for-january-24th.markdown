I'm falling back into relaxed routine with Mai now that we are "living" somewhere relatively stably. Even though our living arrangement is temporary so have all of our other living arrangements been. Hopefully that is not the source of the comfort. 

We were up really early today because of a whining Beta. Though we didn't do anything productive with the time. Once Kai was off to school we took a short nap. When we were functioning again we went to Ikea to look at furniture and hash out plans for our apartment. I think we have a good idea of how we are going to lay out the bedroom and living room but not exactly where things will go. 

Once Kai came home from school we played a little Magic again. I had to let him cheat a bit but he did manage to beat me. He would have in the last game before school as well if he hadn't been so cautious. 

We helped Kai a bit with his homework and I think I confused more than helped when trying to explain some things about whole numbers and fractions. I think part of the problem was not being aware of what he had already learned in school about fractions and so not having the correct vocabulary to communicate. 

After the homework Kai showed me some of Little Big World 2 and some of the cool things he and other people are doing with the level and content creation tools. The game always did look interesting to me but is a PS3 exclusive title so I never played it. I also may have promised to give him my Xbox 360. I'm not sure how Ami will feel about this. 

Mai made butternut squash risotto for dinner and, though it wasn't as cheesy as the risotto she made at my parent's house, it was delicious. Kai didn't like it too well though so we also heated up one of the frozen pizzas. 

After dinner was some TV and cleaning and dog walking. There was some scuffle about showering and TV watching and who would walk Beta. I walked Beta and Kai watched some odd show he was excited about (Level Up). 

After Kai went to sleep Mai and I watched Obama deliver the State of the Union. As much as I dislike the event for its political posturing and masturbatory nature I do really enjoy watching Obama speak. And he does want to get a lot of legislation passed I will support. 

We also watched the Republican Response which was as pessimistic and depressing as Obama's State of the Union was optimistic and inspirational.
