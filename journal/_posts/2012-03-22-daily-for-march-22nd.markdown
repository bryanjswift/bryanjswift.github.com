I spent most of today investigating e-commerce solutions, particularly [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) and [FoxyCart](http://www.foxycart.com) and trying to figure out the best way to integrate them with a site built using [Perch](http://grabaperch.com). This research was mostly so I could figure out how difficult and / or doable the project with [Wondersauce](http://wondersauce.com). I did eventually get the estimate and contract put together and sent out, but not until a little after 18:00 and I haven't heard back yet. The estimate came in a little higher than what they said the budget was so I'm hoping we can still come to an agreement on price and do the project.

I did get to go to lunch with Mai and sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather today. We also walked around a bit after lunch which was quite lovely.

Shortly after I got the contract sent out I had an interview with one of the engineers at [ZocDoc](http://www.zocdoc.com). It was a fairly technical interview and I feel like I bombed it. Not as badly as I bombed the one at [Knewton](http://knewton.com) or [Gilt](http://gilt.com) but still bad. The freezing up on the phone with the guy from ZocDoc makes me particularly concerned about my interview with Google a week from today. Oh and I just realized I'll be working at HUGE that day, which should make things even more interesting.

After the phone interview Mai and I went to [Blue Ribbon Sushi](http://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com/rests_sushi_man_main.htm) for dinner. We spent a lot on dinner, well honestly I spent a lot because I ordered it, but it was delicious. And it really cheered me up after the interview. We called it a celebration dinner for my getting a job but really I just wanted to be indulgent for a night.
