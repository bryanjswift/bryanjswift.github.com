I think I need to thank the reasonable bed time last night because I was up and ready to start the day at 09:00 which hasn't happened for a while. Of course I didn't have anything planned until 12:00 when I was meeting my brother for lunch so I spent the time talking to Amazon customer support about the _[Indroduction to Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Third-Edition-ebook/dp/B007CNRCAO/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1332182943&sr=1-1)_ book crashing every time I re-opened the Kindle app. Unfortunately the rep I talked to was unable to reproduce the problem but it is happening to me every time unless I force close the Kindle app first. 

In addition to talking with customer support I also did some studying for my interview and I started to do the problem set for the first [MIT Introduction to Algorithms course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/) lecture.

Mai and I met Jeremy at [Ippudo](http://www.ippudony.com) for lunch. The wait was only about fifteen minutes, so I've pretty much decided to only every eat there for lunch. We stuffed ourselves pretty well at lunch and then Jer came back to the apartment with us to check it out before he had to fly back to Portland (*sad face* â˜¹). Getting to actually spend time with Jer was great but he was clearly having a tough time with going back to Portland and I had no consolation to offer.

Once Jer left to catch his flight I went back to studying and reading, or maybe this is when I talked to customer support. I don't remember exactly. I do know I exchanged some emails with John Sampogna at [Wondersauce](http://wondersauce.com) after Alex Nguyen gave him my contact information. While exchanging those emails I got a call from George Konetsky from [SANS Consulting Services](http://sans.com/). We talked for a little while about what I was looking for and my rate and etc. He told me about a position they are looking to fill at [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/) and he said he would submit me for it. At least he said he would after he asked me some ridiculous questions about HTML and CSS and JQuery. I also got to take some tests on HTML to prove I knew what the fuck I was talking about. He said some people find it insulting but I don't think it is insulting to be asked to prove some degree of competence, especially when the person being asked has it. After all proving competence is what the whole interview process is about.

In any case, after today, I have a couple of promising interviews lined up in addition to Amanda having said I could expect more working coming my way from Momentum.

Good day. Would play again.
