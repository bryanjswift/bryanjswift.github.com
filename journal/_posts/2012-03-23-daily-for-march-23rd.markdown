I got approval on the budget I sent to Wondersauce, which is great because to take the budget down further would have meant I was seriously undercharging for my time. As it is I think I'm already going to spend far more hours than I budgeted for it. Against the rules I also got started on getting the project set up. I may try and use [PHP Fog](https://phpfog.com/) for hosting rather than [Linode](http://linode.com). It is a cloud hosting solution but it would actually cost less than the Linode with 1024 MB of RAM.

I also talked with [Lynn](http://www.lynnstabile.com/) about having her doing some of the QA work for me. She has a fairly narrow window of availability but I think it will fall in almost exactly when I'm ready for QA so it might work out perfectly. Her hourly rate is a little higher than I anticipated but I'm comfortable with it.

Not much more going on today besides a decent length run with Mai. We probably ended up running for about fifty minutes but walked for fifteen or twenty. I also did [Zombies, Run](https://www.zombiesrungame.com/) for the first time and it was actually kind of awesome. I'm not sure if I will stick with it or not because I don't love the running with headphones and music but I think the game is well executed.
