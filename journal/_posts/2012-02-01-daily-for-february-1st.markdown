## 8:31:55 AM EST

Back and wrist hurt a lot this morning. I couldn't say why today is worse than yesterday but it is. 

Kaare and I are supposed to have lunch today around 13:00, hopefully he won't have to cancel or push it. 

Mai and I are just getting ready to go to the apartment and start putting some of our things together / away.

Mai and I got both wardrobes put together this morning and then walked over to Kaare's office so I could meet him for lunch. 

Kaare and I went to Walker's in TriBeCa  for lunch. I had a grilled chicken breast covered with pistachio butter, mashed potatoes and broccoli drizzled with a balsamic reduction. Kaare had a bacon burger and fries. The food was good but the conversation was better. 

I don't know what, if anything, changed but I was finally totally at ease talking to Kaare again. We talked about his new gig and my prospects for work. Then we talked about some mutual friends and what was going on with them. Then we talked a bit about the Super Bowl and the upcoming time to watch it. And towards the end his asked about the trip. We only talked about the Japan part because he had to get back to work but it was good to talk about. 

I like talking about the volunteer work more than the traveling because it was such a new experience. I hadn't traveled much but being there and experiencing parts of the culture along with parts of the tragedy was far more interesting than traveling around the ring of fire.

We played some hide and seek with Kai after dinner. Dinner was grilled cheese and tomato soup.

I don't have words in me today. Good night.
