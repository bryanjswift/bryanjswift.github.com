We were up around 08:30 today to start putting things into the pantry and off of the bookshelf so we could move the bookshelf and put books and pictures on it eliminating more boxes. We also wanted to prepare for the Time Warner Cable guy to show up. Which he did around 09:30.

The guy came and hooked up our internet while Mai and I were eating breakfast. He hooked up the router / modem and I tested the internet and it was good. I asked if there was a way to change the network password and he said no. Which means I need to call tech support at Time Warner Cable to make any router configuration changes. This is of course incredibly frustrating because it means I can't forward ports to my laptop or give it a dedicated IP. To make things worse I can't seem to get to the configuration pages on the router. I will have to try a factory reset of the router and hope it doesn't break anything with the internet connection.

I had an interview with folks at Knewton today. To my surprise the company actually seems to be better than I expected and the job sounds like it could be interesting. Of course I'm not sure they will actually want me because as is typical the 'technical problem' question threw me for a loop and I ended up talking myself in circles trying to figure out how the fuck to do it.

Knewton is building an adaptive learning platform so students are assisted in learning by being presented with content which is tailored to their learning style and helps build the skills to understand the material. I'm not totally clear on how the analysis is being done but the fact they are doing it is pretty awesome. My only real disappointment was finding out they are selling their product to big publishers and relying on publishers to distribute or make the adaptive learning content available. I think it would be more interesting and valuable if they were selling and marketing directly to schools and teachers so teachers could create course materials and present the content to students as supplemental. In any case it sounded interesting and I may consider it if they make an offer.

After I got back from the interview I sent Darrell an email asking if he had heard anything about the work for grind spaces and the estimate I sent. He said he hadn't done anything with it but they were unlikely to be willing to spend more than $7500. My estimate was for $16000. He asked what could be "spit and chicken wired" together for that kind of money. To be honest I can't think of a different way to doing things than what I sent but I suppose I could use less robust solutions in order to do it.

I've been thinking about it for maybe an hour and a half now and I might be able to shave twenty hours off the estimate and I could mark my hourly rate down to $100 where it really should be anyway.

I just replied to Darrell saying I could get down to about $10,000 but lower than that and I'm really cutting corners (or undercharging) and I don't want things to blow up and be in a situation where I wouldn't be around to fix anything.
