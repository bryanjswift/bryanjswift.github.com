Mom and I went and did some errands today. Nothing exciting just romping around after having lunch at [Hozy's](http://www.hozysgrill.com/), which my mother loves. We went to Barnes and Noble after she got her hair cut after we had lunch. While at Barnes and Noble I sat and did some thinking about Persnicketly and I think I know how I want to proceed regarding the ranking by time period.

I think the best thing for me to do is have a compute method which takes the number of days and runs a map reduce job with the output mapped to a collection dependent on the number of days to cover. This way the calculations are cached and can be read quickly but they can be cached by time period so they should all be fast.

Of course then I didn't act on my planning and instead opted to watch movies.
