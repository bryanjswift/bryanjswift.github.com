Today was kind of a long day. Mai was up around 0800 so she could run errands in the morning and I was up around 0830 so I could pack and eat and be ready to go to New York once she finished running errands. I was ready and she ran a little late so we didn't leave until around 1140, only 40 minutes behind schedule. 

Riding with Mai in the rain makes me more nervous than normal and so I promptly bury my nose in Instapaper once we are moving (which reminds me, Persnicketly should be able to pull from Instapaper as well as Readability). 

The time passes pretty easily and we stop at one of the NJ Turnpike rest stops to pee and get a snack. The snack this time is some chicken tenders from Popeyes. We got a 10 piece chicken tender which turned out to be quite a lot of food. 

Back on the road and back to Instapaper. I didn't read many articles but the ones I read were of considerable length. 

After leaving the rest stop we started talking a bit about whether to put things in storage or if we should just put things into the apartment. Mai wants to paint so I think it is silly to put things in the apartment while that is happening. Mai insists everything will be fine covered by a drop cloth. I relent because she is probably right and it isn't worth arguing about. 

Once in the city we head right to the apartment and start emptying the contents of her trunk into the apartment. Upon entering the apartment again I am assaulted by just how small it really is. And how awkward it will be when we have furniture in it. 

The bedroom would be the sanctuary but we need so much closet space it will end up crowded as well. I am not thrilled. Of course it is too late because it is paid for and we have keys and I have said so many times that I like it and I can't back out now. 

We leave the apartment and Mai wants to drive to Ami's. I look up directions and am not vocal enough about how difficult I think it will be to park. So we go and end up missing the turn and accidentally taking the Brooklyn Battery tunnel back to Brooklyn. Now I can convince her we should park and take the train but that means finding street parking. At 1730. In the rain. We hunt around Brooklyn Heights while I get more and more frustrated by her lack of attention to the road, her irritation at the noisy wipers and the general lack of parking. We spend 45 or so minutes cruising around Brooklyn Heights looking for a place to park before I decide to move us further along the R line. This proves to be a bright move and we park fairly quickly near the Pacific St stop on the R. 

Now that we are out of the car an on foot I feel a lot better but she is visually frustrated by my curt demeanor while we were hunting. I ask about it and she is honest so we just leave it alone and allow ourselves to get over it. I think her willingness to do this is one of my favorite things about her right now. 

We take the train to Ami's apartment and meet Kai and hang for a while before she feeds us. Dinner is delicious lasagna and some salad. 

After dinner we just chill for a while reading our various internets and talking about normal conversational things. Quite pleasant really.

I wish I could stop worrying about this apartment decision that has been made and I can do nothing about but I just can't seem to let it go. I will continue gnawing on it for a while and hope I don't come to regret any of this plan.
