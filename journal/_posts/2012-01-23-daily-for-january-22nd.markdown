I'm really looking forward to getting back to New York full time. I feel like I am mostly back to work full time with the about of effort I've been putting into Persnicketly. I know it is a side project and not likely to earn me money but I like working on it and I think I can still do some interesting things with it. Tomorrow we take the first car load of stuff up to New York even though it can't go into the apartment yet because it won't be done it feels like the beginnings of the move and that is great. I am definitely nervous about living together but realistically we have been doing it for a while just not in a place that was "ours". 

I am also a little worried about our lack of space. The size of the apartment would be fine for just me but with the two of us in the space it could get a little cramped. Especially if I end up working from home. I suppose if I end up continuing to do freelance work I can get space at [grind](http://grindspaces.com/) or a space through [loosecubes](http://loosecubes.com/). Actually the loosecubes office is a pretty short train ride away and so is Miami Ad School where I'm sure Mehera wouldn't mind me camping out and working.

Now I just need to find work. I know it is out there but I need to really start looking for it. And preferably work that lets me work from anywhere rather than having to be in an office somewhere. Actually what I'd really like is to be making enough dough to split some office space with Alex and maybe other freelancers I want to be around or work with. 

I should ask Alex if he knows anyone looking for a developer for project based work. All of my contacts really. Doug mentioned he was looking for a couple freelance debs. Mike Cavaliere usually knows folks too. And I can always turn to a recruiter if need be. I would really prefer to find project work rather than contract work.
