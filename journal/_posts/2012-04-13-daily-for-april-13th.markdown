I stopped writing for a while because I realized I was writing almost exclusively negative things about a client I had named. The thing is, there are in fact negative things about any job, especially right at the beginning. That's when all the figuring out has to happen and when coming into a project that has been going on for eight months or so there is a lot of figuring out to do. I just finished my third week and while I still don't love the architecture having spent more time with it means I do know how to navigate it competently and so I'm able to sort through how things are wired together relatively quickly. And I've started refactoring some things I have found which need refactoring and [DRYing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) up things in need of DRYing.

Additionally, I've started to get to know the other developers a little bit and so I'm becoming comfortable with the routine of working and the fact of being in an office most of the day. I've also gotten a fair bit of work done on the project for Wondersauce. I've only logged about twenty-five hours on it so far but I feel like they have been productive hours and though the exercise of exploring shopping cart options only to have [Shopify](http://shopify.com) seem somewhat dictated from the client I believe I can make Shopify play nicely using a custom built [Perch](http://grabaperch.com) app and the Shopify API. I've been trying to do an hour or two a day on the Wondersauce project after I get home from Huge.

Some days the time has been difficult because I am increasingly distracted by [Skyrim](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Skyrim) which is a stunning game. In addition to not writing for two weeks, I also haven't been running in two weeks. I'd like to change that tomorrow if I can get myself up early enough to go before I have to get ready to see [A Streetcar Named Desire](http://www.streetcaronbroadway.com/) with Blair Underwood and Wood Harris. I'm excited to see Wood Harris in something other than the wire and I haven't been to a play on Broadway (a couple musicals but no plays) so this is going to be awesome.
