Mai got on a bus this morning to go down to DC for a couple of days to run up the last of her things (to be brought up) and return with her car so we can fetch things from storage. 

We are actually getting close to having the apartment put together. It looks mostly settled but there are still boxes hidden and I am definitely missing having a desk. 

My next task is to finish my taxes and to get a job. Which means I have to sort out the full time offers and decide if I am actually interested in them while also looking for lucrative freelance opportunities.

I did my taxes today and while I am pretty certain some things are fucked up I owe the federal government $6600 an New York State $700 which means I get to keep about $14000 of my savings. This is super awesome because it means I can almost pay off all of my credit card debt without getting a debt consolidation loan. Essentially this gives me some financial breathing room of which we were in desperate need. 

I emailed Jonathan Silvers and he said I would be receiving a 1099 from his accountant and I updated the address he had for me. Hopefully it comes soon so I can actually file my taxes and take my money back. The last thing I need to complete them is a tax id number from Jonathan. 

After doing taxes I rewarded myself with a small pie from Lombardi's (with meatballs, yum) and set up the Mac Mini and the Wii. So now I can watch TV and play video games rather than be productive. Oh wait...

In any case it is one small step closer to having the apartment all put together so even if it was a time sink enabling step I am glad it got done.
