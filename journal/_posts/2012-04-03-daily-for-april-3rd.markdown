Half day at Huge trying to get some concept of what I need to be working on. I can't tell if I'm disorganized and unfocused or my part of the project is.

The interview with ZocDoc seemed to go horribly. Of the three interview sessions I thought one of them went well and the other two were kind of bombs blowing up in my face. I just have to wait and see what they thought because not only has my knack for interviewing well gone away but my knack for understanding what they thought has gone with it. Maybe it all comes down to a lack of confidence, I'm not sure I'm cut out for some of these roles I've been interviewing for, which is part of the appeal, but the lack of confidence comes across in the interview and clouds my ability to judge them.

I used to like going in for interviews and now I'm starting to dread it.
