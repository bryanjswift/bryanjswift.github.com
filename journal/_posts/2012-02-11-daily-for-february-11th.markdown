Woke up a little late today but still in plenty of time to go and see Amanda Schultz for lunch. I met her at Ippudo and the wait was only about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad given the number of people in the waiting area and our previous experience with the wait there. 

The food was amazing as expected. We had pork buns to start, with edamame of course, and I had the somewhat spicy pork one which I can't remember the name of. Amanda had tori ramen. 

For the most part we talked about the trip before we sat down and while eating we largely talked about work. Most interestingly we talked about me thinking I might need a producer for my freelance work. I told her the story of what happened with Jonathan Silvers and how it ended. The end is what leads me to the conclusion of needing someone between myself and the client because I have almost certainly burnt the bridge between myself and him which completely cuts me off from all of his contacts which is an avenue into a network I simply didn't have before. I'm fairly certain she would be willing to help with this role but I'm not certain how the arrangement would work.
