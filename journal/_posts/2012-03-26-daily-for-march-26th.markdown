Today was my first day at [HUGE](http://hugeinc.com) but before my first day I got up and went for a run. Waking at 06:15 was difficult but I got out of bed around 06:30 and got the exercise clothes and got out the door. The run was difficult but I've been better hydrated and had consumed food before almost all of my runs in the last couple of months. This was back to 'the old way'. While 'the new way' is clearly better it would mean getting up even earlier.

After the run I walked to the HUGE offices. Once there I, with the group of four other new hires, spent two hours going over paperwork and doing introductory type stuff and getting a tour. After the paperwork and introductory stuff I was shown to my workstation and introduced to part of the team. Since the introduction was an interruption around lunchtime we ended up going and grabbing some lunch and bringing it back to the office. Afterward I got some set up instructions from my team lead, Rob, and following some fiddling got the environment up and running. I spent some time looking at some existing code and exploring some things marked `TODO` in hopes of finding something to work on.

Towards the end of the day Rob sent me a couple of bugs in JIRA. They were both well diagnosed and I was able to find the appropriate locations in the code base quickly and knock them out before leaving. I think tomorrow, in lieu of some direction, I'll go back to attempting to clean up some `TODO`s.

In the morning sometime I got an email from John at Wondersauce, he wanted to make some amendments to the contract I sent over. I told him I would get the updates to him tonight and so I made the appropriate edits and sent over the new file once I had a chance to sit down at home after the day at HUGE. I'm glad I had started exploring some of the work for the Wondersauce project because I'm not confident I can accomplish the tasks set in front of me but it would be nice to have a signed contract and a check on the way.

Also in my email this morning was an invitation to an on-site interview with ZocDoc. Remember the interview I though I bombed on the 22nd? I guess I didn't do as horribly as I thought. They want to do it on Friday, the 30th. I just sent a reply saying I couldn't do it this week (since I already have a phone screen with Google Thursday). I asked if we could do it next week.

The onboarding process at HUGE was frustrating but maybe it is always frustrating joining a larger organization. They tend to be more mired in process and less interested in squeezing productivity out of new people immediately. This is in contrast to the last couple of places where I've done contract work.
