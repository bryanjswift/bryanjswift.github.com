Slept in late and then went to get breakfast at [the deli](http://www.mikesdeliatlazysundae.com/) so Mai could not be in trouble with Mama (Christina). Then we went to the post office to mail Jer his pants from Uni Qlo and some thank you cards Mai had written.

Then we came back to the house and sat around on our bums. I saw there had been a couple of emails sent to Persnicketly so I answered them which motivated me (briefly) to work on it. So I put in a little time laying the groundwork to implement an RSS feed for articles in the top lists. I think I will need to maintain another collection for article ids which have already been in the list. Or maybe a previous ranking or something because I don't want the list to be constantly spamming people.

After that we watched some TV. A couple episodes of [Last Man Standing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Man_Standing_(U.S._TV_series)) which was actually kind of funny and then some episodes of [Alcatraz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz_(TV_series)) which was terrible. And then an episode of [Californication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Californication_(TV_series)) which I love.

Then we hit the iPhones for some game playing and now it is bed time. Good night.
