I skipped yesterday. I did it consciously because I didn't think anything particularly interesting had happened but I realize now I should have written it anyway just to retain the habit. In fact I tried to do an 'interval run' yesterday slow jog 1km then fast jog 1km then slow jog 1km then fast jog 1km. I ended up having an average pace of about 6 min / km which is about what my normal pace is. I guess that is fine because the point was to try and accustom myself to jogging at a faster speed not to track speed.

I didn't go jogging today because of how exhausted I was yesterday. I also slept in until about 11:30 which was nice but probably a mistake. I also had an angry dream in which a client's staff was accusing me of sabotaging the website by deleting data. This dispute apparently went to court and involved a lot of yelling. At least I didn't yell at anyone in my fugue state as Mai was getting ready to leave this morning.

Mai and I mailed out our Christmas cards. Well most of them. We didn't quite make it to the post office in time to see a real person and getting stamps for our international cards was frustrating, to say the least, from the automatic machine. More frustrating for her but then I got frustrated with her for being so frustrated with the machine.

I think I'd like to try collecting a link list for each day of stuff I found compelling. I'm not sure how I'm going to do this though. Preferably it would be automatic, maybe I can create a Jekyll plugin that pulls a list of links for the day from my Pinboard account.
