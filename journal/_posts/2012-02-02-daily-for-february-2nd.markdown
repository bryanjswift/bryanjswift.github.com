## 8:39:32 AM EST

Mai was up once again at the appointed hour, 07:00, to get Kai up and ready for school. I stayed in bed until Kai got back from walking Beta, around 07:30. Mai made waffles and some amazing scrambled eggs for breakfast while Kai and I looked at and talked about Magic cards. 

After breakfast we all started picking up so the place wasn't such a wreck when the cleaning people came. 

Now waiting for Mai to be ready so we can continue putting our apartment together.

Mai and I came back to our apartment to continue putting things together. We just finished putting my dresser together and realized it has no fixtures on the outside. So the dresser is in the wardrobe but I have no way to open the drawers. I guess it is a good thing we had to go back to IKEA anyway.
