# January 30, 2012

## 7:46:39 AM EST

Beta got us up at 07:20 this morning with the "I need to go out" cries. Took him out for a pee and a poo. 

## 8:54:15 AM EST

I called a couple of places trying to find labor to help us out. The two I talked to didn't mind the last minute nature of the request but didn't seem pleased with my only wanting help unloading. 

More interesting though is my near complete paralysis when faced with needing to call people and ask for help or services which are not what they really have on offer. I don't want to call and custom order. I am not sure why this is the case. Making matters worse is the overwhelming number of places to choose from. There are so many listings for labor on craigslist and there is no obvious way to filter them. It makes the whole experience daunting and random feeling. I object to not feeling in control and so the randomness really bothers me especially because I have no way to structure the situation and impose some order.

We got my stuff picked up and are presently unloading. We have been at it for an hour or so already and we probably have two more to go. It is slow going but I think it will be fine. 

The only kink in the plan is Kai apparently left school with a stomach ache so we are a little unsure what that does to our plans. 

## 9:36:55 PM EST

Getting everything into the apartment took close to four and a half hours. Four and a half hours of exhausting staircases with boxes and furniture. 

Paul brought Kai to us around 13:30 and we got him set up on his computer so he could hang out with Beta while we hauled. Eventually he got sick of being there and started asking how much longer. At which point we recruited him to help us carry some some of the lighter things up. He made a couple of trips and was helpful just by being with Beta because Mai and I had been alternating staying in the apartment so he wasn't alone.

We returned the truck a little late and then took the train from Carroll St to Ami's. On the way we were talking big about wanting to make baked mac and cheese so after we got to Ami's and I showered Mai and I walked Whole Foods and got groceries but it was about 19:30 by the time we got back so we traded mac and cheese to tomorrow and made breakfast for dinner. 

Mai and I are now trying to kill time so we stay up until at least 22:00 so don't feel like total bums.
