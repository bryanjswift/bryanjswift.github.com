Up early to meet Ivan in Gramercy to take another look at the place at 24th & Park as well as see the apartments in 141 E 26th St. We liked the apartments at 141 E 26th but didn't love them and Mai was right about the size of the place at 24th & Park it is quite reasonable and livable. He showed us another apartment around 20th St & 3rd Ave; it was adorable but kind of small.

After seeing the last apartment Ivan asked if we wanted to put an application in on the place on Park and we nearly did but decided, in light of the $1000 'good faith fee', to wait until we saw the two bedroom in Carroll Gardens again. We were scheduled to see it at 13:30 in the afternoon and finished with Ivan around 11:45 so we took our time walking back to the train and stopped to get dumplings for lunch at Rickshaw (23rd btwn 5th & 6th).

David met us just around 13:30 to let us into the apartment on Union between Smith and Court. We looked around again and took some measurements and realized it was in fact plenty of space for everything to fit comfortably despite Mai convincing both her and myself last night it was too small.

Given the enlightening re-viewings we had of both the apartments we liked Mai and I left David's company to deliberate about which one we wanted to seek. We didn't make much headway until we called Mom to talk it through a bit. Mom pointed out we could make the apartment in Gramercy feel more like home because it would be us doing the decorating of the primary views when entering the apartment rather than whoever designed the kitchen in Carroll Gardens. So we called Ivan to tell him we were in if it was still available. He said it was so we got onto the train and headed into the city.

When we got off the train (after I'd gone from worried about apartments to worried about money) we called Ivan to figure out where to meet him (Mai also had a voicemail from him) and he told us the apartment had an application on it, a strong one, so it was gone. Ivan pounced right back getting us to agree to see a place in lower Chelsea (14th btwn 8th & 9th). It was an attractive place but a little bit smaller than we wanted it to be. Ivan then gave us the speech about managing expectations so I'm pretty sure he's written us off which is a shame because we actually liked him.

Reeling from the disappointment of the lost apartment and the lackluster follow-up we headed to Argo Tea at 26th & 7th so I could meet with Britt Myers of [Highline Games](http://highlinegames.com) about a possible freelance gig. The meeting went well, we had a good talk and he seems like a good guy, but I'm not sure I'm super excited about the work I would likely be doing.

After meeting with Britt, Mai and talked for a while about how we wanted to handle the apartment search going forward. We thought we might just be able to call David and explain the situation (since we had told him we were passing) and see if we could still put in an application. But then we got to talking about what if we could find an apartment for less and so now we are starting over with a lower 'max budget' to see if we can get a different range of apartments. 

Then we went down to meet Alex for dinner. The three of us went to Ditch Plains to eat and Mai had sloppy joes (for Mai) and sloppy dogs (for me). Alex told me [Gavin Becker](http://twitter.com/grokstar) was starting [a new company](http://bondsy.com) and may be looking for a tech lead which is a pretty interesting idea.

Eventful, stressful, disappointing day topped off with seeing a good friend and finally relaxing back into the city a bit.
