I didn't sleep too well last night. The heating and A/C unit in Ami's room kept waking me up. When Mai's alarm went off at 07:00 I knew sleep was over. I got up but Mai stayed in bed until I shook her twenty minutes later and told her she needed to wake Kai. He was already awake but it really signaled the start of the day. 

Kai is off to school now and Mai and I are getting ready to do some grocery shopping and then go start putting our apartment together. 

I heard back from Britt. He said they wanted to bring me on even if it is just to consult with them on setting up Parse. So at least I can start earning some money soon.

Talked with Britt from Highline Games around 10:00 and they want to bring me on to consult for Parse and to do some additional work related to how they manage their word list.

I think the word list project could be interesting and the Parse consulting is easy money. Yay working.

I got the contract from Britt and it gave him the sole ability to determine the term of the contract. I sent it back and said I won't sign it as is and am awaiting a response. 

Mai and I are headed to the grocery store to get eggs and bacon.

Britt said the edits were fine and I got an updated contract. Now I just need to sign it and send it over. It feels good to have the comfort level to say no about contract terms and be able to revise them.

Kai was being kind of a little shit tonight, arguing with both Mai and myself about pretty much everything. I've also decided playing Magic with him, while interesting for the sake of nostalgia isn't actually all that much fun. He doesn't like to play by the rules and he doesn't want to win so much as he wants to get best creatures on the board and marvel at his army. Maybe it is an understanding that comes with age but it also speaks to an attitude of entitlement. He wants to win just because he is playing, not because he deserves to.

On a brighter note, Mai made baked mac and cheese with bacon tonight for dinner and it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.
