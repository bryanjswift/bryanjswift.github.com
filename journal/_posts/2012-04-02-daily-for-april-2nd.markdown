Back to work today. The client team got split into smaller teams today and the smaller teams are focused on specific parts of the site build. This is a strategy I support but somehow two of the newest members of the team are on the same team. I'm not sure this part of the plan is as good but we shall see how things play out. I also didn't feel particularly well directed during my first day on this new plan but again we shall see how the week goes.

On another note I received a signed contract from Wondersauce today so it is time to put my head down and bang some work out after work. Which will be fun and interesting and hopefully not make Mai hate me for working all the time.

I also attended a freelancer's union meeting / support group thing tonight. It was interesting talking about how I see my brand and how I can better define it. I think I also provided some decent advice to the other attendees.
