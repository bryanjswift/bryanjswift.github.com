Slept in until forever again today. This is getting to be a habit I'm not ok with. Once we got up it was a pretty good day. Went to the gym with Mai and ran and did a somewhat easy lift. Then we went and picked up my shoes that were at the cobbler. He magically made the salt and water damage disappear. For $20. Amazing.

After the cobbler (which was after lunch) we went grocery shopping for supplies to make chili. Then we made chili and ate it. After dinner we watched some TV and then went upstairs. I tried to work on Persnicketly some more but I'm down the rabbit hole of trying to get rid of dispatch because it really bothers me. As a result I'm trying to change all the JSON parsing to use Jackson and Jerkson and the code looks ugly. I'm sure there is a better way to handle it but I'm not sure I care. I just want dispatch out and even if the code is ugly I can at least understand what it is doing.
