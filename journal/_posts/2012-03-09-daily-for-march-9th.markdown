It has been a long time. Again. I think once the habit of writing once a day was broken it was too easy to stop doing it throughout the day when I got busy with other things. 

None the less here we are. I finished up a project today. Amanda Schultz hired me to do some work for a concert event Momentum is helping to produce at SXSW. The concept was pretty simple but the front end animations were too complex for me to do well in a reasonable amount of time so I asked Alex to do those while I worked on the server side stuff. To be honest it worked out brilliantly. I got to do the part I find to be most interesting and Alex did great work on the animation and display on the front end. There may be a touch of extra work to do so they can use it on a different system in Austin but at this point it honestly might be too late. I should hear tomorrow morning if they want to go forward with it. 

Mai is in DC tonight and was last night and will be again tomorrow. She went down to do some last cleanup at Dave's and to finalize selling her car. 

Now that I got a gig finished it is back to the hunt for me. At least I can update the old resume and make it look more like I'm working again.

I went for a short run today over the newly reopened pedestrian path of the Manhattan Bridge and I felt like I was struggling the whole way. Additionally my legs hurt a lot, well didn't hurt exactly but didn't feel quite right, when I was done. I think I'm going to take it pretty easy tomorrow but go for a long walk in preparation for the Run For Japan on Sunday. As it is I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do the whole thing. 

On the brighter side Amanda said to go ahead with the standalone and web packaging of the SXSW GUI Alex did so we he put them together late this morning and we sent them over. I haven't heard anything since but assuming no news is good news. In any case it is another chunk of change for this gig. 

Back to the sadder side I got a tax due notice from New York State in the mail today. According to the notice TurboTax did not correctly calculate the tax owed based on my New York City residency and my working in Yonkers. It appears as though I am getting dinged twice because I was working in Yonkers. As a result I owe another $1750 I don't have. I owe it by April 17th so hopefully I get a paycheck of some kind before then. 

Speaking of paychecks I have to go back on the hunt for work now that this gig with Amanda is over. And Mehera has been unable to fire her developer and so there is no need for me to put together a proposal for the site development.
