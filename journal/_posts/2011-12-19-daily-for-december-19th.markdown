Mai and I mailed the last of our Christmas Cards. These were all the ones going to international destinations. 

A couple of days ago my Mom brought up her grandmother's engagement ring and said she wasn't asking a question or pressuring me but wanted to tell me while she was thinking about it that the diamonds in the ring were always supposed to go to me. Discussions about our relationship leveling up to the engagement place always knock me right out of my comfort zone. I've been stewing about it for a couple of days and though I don't need to do anything with the knowledge it has me a bit rattled.

Ami Moore sent me a message on Facebook saying she knew someone who was looking to sublet and asked what the story was. I replied with an abbreviated version of why we were looking to sublet because I wasn't really sure what she meant by the story.
