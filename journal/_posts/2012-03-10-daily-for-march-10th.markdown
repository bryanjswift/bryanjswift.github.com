Pretty lazy day today. The laziness was by design but the degree of it was not. I wanted to rest up before the run I am doing tomorrow. The run I'm not sure I am actually ready for. However I did want to take a decent length walk and Mai said yesterday she would go with me on this walk. Sadly she was all headachey and stayed in bed almost the entire day. As a result I lounged about and finished reading _Damned_ by Chuck Palahniuk and then started reading things in my RSS feeds. After a lot of reading I did end up going on a minor walk to the store but I don't think it was enough to stretch my legs out significantly for the day. I any case the day is done and I need to get some sleep so I can wake up early to go run 10k for Run for Japan and hopefully survive the experience.
