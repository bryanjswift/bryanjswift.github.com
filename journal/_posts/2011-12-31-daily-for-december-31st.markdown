I spent some more time reflecting on how things have played out and I'm still content with my decisions. I tried to write about the things I was feeling about the creeping depression of indecision which would have been difficult enough without trying to use zero pronouns. I know it is important to write without them for legitimate 'article' like material but maybe I should start doing it when I'm not tackling material inexorably tied to *my* emotions.

My parents and I went to the Merrell store to get my mom new shoes and Dad said he wanted to start walking/jogging again. I think I can persuade him to go for a short one with me to at least get the process started. I'm not sure if going with me will help or hurt though.

Also, Happy New Year internet.
