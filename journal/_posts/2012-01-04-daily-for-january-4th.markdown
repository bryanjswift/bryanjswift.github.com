My [GR1](www.goruck.com/products-page/rucksacks/gr1/) arrived via FedEx today. Which is pretty exciting. It is a good looking bag and seems to compress down well when empty. Hopefully it compresses down as well when only partially full. It is big enough for a couple of changes of clothes and other 'essentials'. I'm looking forward to carrying it and getting it to form to my back.
