My [GR1](www.goruck.com/products-page/rucksacks/gr1/) arrived via FedEx today. Which is pretty exciting. It is a good looking bag and seems to compress down well when empty. Hopefully it compresses down as well when only partially full. It is big enough for a couple of changes of clothes and other 'essentials'. I'm looking forward to carrying it and getting it to form to my back.

I mostly spent the day being lazy but I did get some work done on Persnicketly again. Work doesn't necessarily mean progress though and I'm afraid I made the site a lot slower with what I did. I wanted everything to do a calculation like the recent articles calculation but I think it is too expensive for the time periods I want because it is quite slow.

I've been trying to think of other ways to handle it and the best I have right now is to go back to doing fixed time periods where the results are precalculated. These tables would continue to be updated every few hours and the site renders would come from there. The method doesn't sit right with me but I don't see a better way to do things. Maybe restructuring data would make the calculations easier but I haven't tinkered with it at all lately.

For now I'm going to change the indices a bit and deploy again. Minor improvements are better than nothing.
