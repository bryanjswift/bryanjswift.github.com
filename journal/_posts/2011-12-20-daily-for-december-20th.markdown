I got a call from Grammie telling me how much she enjoyed our Christmas card. She said it made her laugh right out loud and that it was wonderful This just puts a big smile on my face.

I implemented finished implementing Metrics in Persnicketly and am ready to deploy again. I'm actually a little nervous because I haven't done it for a while. However, there aren't any template or consumer facing changes so it shouldn't matter much. Plus no one really uses it so I'm sure it'll be fine.

I add some styles to my blog here. It is still barebones but it should at least be useable now. Writings from the Wordpress blog aren't linked to but they were generally awful anyway. I don't think I want to include them in the archives and I don't want to link to previous writings or anything. I'm including them so I don't "break the internet" even though I don't think it would matter for my corner of the internet.

Mom goes in for surgery early tomorrow morning, which sucks, but I've known it was coming and it should be relatively minor as surgeries go so I'm not terribly worried. Trying not to be terribly worried. On a brighter note I heard back from Ryan Snyder at [Simple](http://simple.com) and I'm going to talk on the phone with him this Thursday (2011 December 22) at 13.00. My heart started racing when I saw I got an email from them. It is strange how much I want this.
