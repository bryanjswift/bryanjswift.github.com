Having Google App Engine charge me for my miniscule usage is pretty aggravating. It isn't a lot ($2.10) but my app ([Quote Crate](http://www.quotecrate.com)) is operating well within the free limits but I'm getting changed a minimum charge anyway. I just disabled billing which should fix this. However, it might be interesting to port the app to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and use [MongoHQ](http://mongohq.com) as the datastore. The searching could theoretically be done using Mongo's GridFS.

Talked to Mom a bit about why I'm so freaked out about moving back to New York and rejoining real life. A lot of it has to do with not being sure I'm going to be able to find work I want to do. If Simple wants to hire me I'm going to have a problem on my hands but I can't plan my future (meaning the next couple of months really) based on the possibility of them hiring me. I think the best plan is for me to get back to NYC and into a sublet for a month (or two) while Mai and I find a place to be ours. That way I can be back around my friends and in the tech culture again. Having not had to work for so long the work part of my life is essentially gone and so I don't have anything about it to love right now.

We also talked a bit about why moving to Japan or Spain for her to go and teach is different from us moving to Portland for me to work. Moving to a foreign country is an experience wholly different from staying somewhere in the U.S. of A. and it has value outside of a job I may or may not love.

I think I'm finished with Christmas shopping except I still don't have a thing for Jeremy. I thought about putting the money he never helped me put away for him in a high yield savings account set aside for him (or an investment account with Apple stock). However, that feels like a thing I should just do, not as a gift for this year.
