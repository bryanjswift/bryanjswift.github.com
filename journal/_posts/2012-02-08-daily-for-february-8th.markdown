Did some freebie work for Behnam at NoMimes yesterday and today. He wanted me to add a small bit of text to one page. I know I ought to have charged for it but it took all of five minutes. It would have taken more effort to record and invoice the time than the invoice was worth. 

I think I may be able to use this opening to ask if they want me to update the site to use a CMS. Adding in Perch to the NoMimes site shouldn't be too difficult.

Mai and I are nearly out of things to do for putting our apartment together until we get some of our new furniture. We still need to order our bed and a kitchen island thing with a drawer. 

Additionally I need a desk and I think we are still going to have things left over. We also need to get a pantry to put the food that is on our bookshelf in.

I have also agreed to be on a Freelancer's Union call about the Freelancer Payment Protection Act which we are still trying to pass through the state legislation. I think it is a call to discuss strategy for this year and I am not sure how relevant it will be for where I am this year but it seems like a valuable use of my time for now.
