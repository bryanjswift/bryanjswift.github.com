Up at a relatively normal time to take Mai to Rebecca's house so she can get paid to play with the kids today. Then I came back and got into bed for a little while because it was cold and I was feeling remarkably lazy. Around 10:15 I realized if I didn't get up and go running I wouldn't have time to do it before meeting [Doug Smith](http://twitter.com/dascentral) for lunch. So I got up and went running in the cold ass weather.

I didn't get far before I decided I didn't want to be doing it so I ran down to the bottom of the hill and then turned around. Not only did I only go two kilometers or so but my watch never figured out where I was so I don't even have a record of it. 

I hope I will try the running again tomorrow but I'll need to wear some gloves. The numb hands just was not alright.

I met Doug at [Ireland's Four Provinces](http://4psva.com) (aka 4Ps) for lunch. The food was decent and the place was nearly empty. We talked mostly about travel and my upcoming work situation and what was going on at AKQA DC. The normal catch-up stuff. The more interesting bit was toward the end when we started talking about distance running/biking.

After lunch I came back to the house and hung out while waiting for Mai to be finished with the child rearing. Later there was shopping at Harris Teeter so we could make dinner. After dinner we tried to go through some of her things in storage but because I don't remember well the things I have (or the things Jeremy took to Portland) I wasn't terribly helpful which was frustrating for the both of us.
