After a night of worrying about whether or not we were about to get scammed on this apartment I finally got to sleep, though it wasn't restful. Mai's phone rang around 10:00 and it was David wanting to set up a time for us to meet with the building owner so we could be approved. We couldn't get there immediately so we set to meet them at 14:30.

Mai and I busied ourselves with packing our shit and getting ready to go. Then we went and got lunch at Pedro's on Jay St. The burritos were pretty good. Post burrito we headed in to meet Nir and David at the apartment. It took all of 15 minutes to get there so we were about 15 minutes early for the 14:30 meeting. To kill some time we decided to camp out in Starbucks for a while so as to not be standing in the cold (it was ~ 30° and windy).

We did go and meet them right on time and they were there meeting. The prepped us, somewhat condescendingly, to meet "Jack" the building owner, an older Chinese gentleman. He talked to us (well mostly Mai) and decided we were okay so we worked out the money numbers and David left to print up the lease and I left to get certified checks.

We all met back a short time later at the plumbing shop but Jack had left, apparently not understanding we were coming back to sign the lease. So I signed the lease and left the checks with David but got the keys. After making a copy of the keys for Nir and David so they could continue to check on the work Mai and I went back up into the apartment to take a look and some rough measurements. We decided the bedroom is about 14' x 12' and the living room is about 10' x 12'. So the apartment is likely to be nearly 350 ft².

Once done looking at the apartment we headed back to the car and she drove to Northern VA. We went and had dinner at Clare & Don's and then sat and talked with Rebecca Tax for a while before coming back to the house in Dunn Loring. While talking to Rebecca and having dinner we did some preliminary floor planning.
