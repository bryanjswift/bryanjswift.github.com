I got up with Mai this morning to get Kai up for school. After breakfast and homework we played another round of Magic. I think Kai is getting frustrated at losing all the time because he keeps wanting to cheat to win. Thing is he is doing it in obvious ways so it is clear that is what is happening. 

I don't understand the protocol on this. Do I let him win? Should I try and help him out so he wins within the rules? I have never understood these things. Maybe it is because I don't remember being as competitive when I was younger. After all it was a while before my parents let me get my first video game system and we didn't play many board games. 

After Kai went off to school I went for a jog. I left around 08:15 and got back around 09:00. I felt like I was going at a pretty good pace but I wasn't wearing my GPS watch so I don't know exactly how far or how fast. My guess is I went around four miles in forty minutes which is a little less than six and a half kilometers which is a pace of about six and a quarter minutes per kilometer which is an improvement over what has become my norm.

Mom says I was indeed competitive and we played games endlessly until I won. However because everything was so black and white for me as a kid, right or wrong and no grey area, cheating was never really an option. 

I don't remember any of it but I certainly believe it.

Mai and I took Beta to go and see our apartment. Beta was afraid of the stairs but otherwise it was fine. We took some measurements of our apartment and I think settled on a layout for the bedroom and living room. The kitchen is a little in flux still but I think it is also mostly nailed down. 

Then we went to check on Mai's car because she gets nervous when she doesn't see it for too long. On our way to the car it started raining a fair bit so we decided to drive to my storage locker in Fort Greene so I could get some sneakers.

I also did some rooting around in storage to try and find my Magic: The Gathering cards because I thought I had some in the apartment but I couldn't find them in any of the boxes I could get to. The ones I am looking for may still be in there but I can't remember where in the apartment they were, or if they were there at all.

I texted my mom and asked if she knew where they were and she said there were a lot of them at the house. Against better judgement I asked her to send them all here.

Some movement on the job front today. I got an email from Britt at Highline Games about some server side development he needs someone to do for a new feature they are planning to roll out. I have a call tomorrow with a colleague of Britt's to talk about what the work would actually entail but from the specification document he sent with what they are planning to do I don't think it will be terribly difficult work and he has, in principle, agreed to pay a rate of ninety-five an hour. So yay!

I tried to reach out to Darrell about going to see him tomorrow to talk more seriously about the gig at [co:](http://www.cocollective.com) but I never heard back from him. This has some weight with re-enforcing my feelings expressed when talking with Alex that I like Darrell but I don't like the idea of relying on him for a paycheck because none of the times we have tried to work together has it worked out.

After Mai and I got back from our errands today we didn't really do anything other than heat up leftovers for dinner. Mai played some 'hide and seek' with Kai but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

My mom did ship a bunch of stuff to us today, including my Magic cards, and it should all arrive Saturday or Monday. I also ordered [a knife](http://shop.coolmaterial.com/products/credit-card-knife) from [Cool Material](http://coolmaterial.com). I'm hoping it can replace the Buck knife I've been carrying because while I like the Buck knife it is kind of awkward in my back pocket.
