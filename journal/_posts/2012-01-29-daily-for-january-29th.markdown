## 7:40:50 AM EST

Beta woke me at 07:15 and so we went for a walk. He peed and pooped relatively promptly, do we are off to a good start today. 

## 9:18:18 AM EST

We are getting breakfast at the deli before we get on the road headed north. But we are finally out of Dave's house which I am grateful for. He is kind of smothering with his attempts at helpfulness. He did agree to send Mai the recipe for his bean soup though. 

Today is going to be a long day of hauling boxes us seemingly endless flights of stairs. I am not looking forward to it but it has to be done. Considering going to U-Haul to get a temporary worker to help us move boxes.

I'm continually amazed at how well behaved Beta is in the car. He just lays down and is quiet. Quite remarkable.

It took a little longer than expected to drive to NYC from Dave's. We arrived via the Holland Tunnel to the west side of Manhattan around 15:35 and it was 16:15 by the time we got onto the Manhattan Bridge. Since Public Storage was expected to close at 17:00 we decided to just go to IKEA and buy our wardrobe then go to our apartment and start unloading. 

We parked in front of our apartment around 19:00 and due to street cleaning for Chinese New Year and our having to wait until some barricades were removed we got the spot directly in front of our door. 

We moved boxes and furniture upstairs for about three hours before we were too tired to continue. After some discussion the plan is to try and hire some help to meet us at our apartment around noon tomorrow to move everything upstairs. Which means we need to get up earlyish (shouldn't be a problem thanks to Beta) and go to the storage locker to put my things in the truck (which we left in front of Public Storage on Emerson Pl) and then get to the apartment by noon. 

I figure if we hire two or three guys to help us for two hours we should be able to finish or at least come close to it. If we finish in two hours we should have enough time to return the truck and get back to the apartment before Kai gets home. 

On the train back to Ami's, except the R wasn't running at Jay St so now we are waiting for an A train which is what we just got off. Long day.
