Now I'm up. Supposed to do laundry today. I think I can fit it into my Go Ruck bag and the Freelancer's Union bag but maybe it would be better to use the bag I am going to wash anyway. In any case I think I best get started. I wonder what to do with the things she wants to drip dry.

Finally heard back from Darrell today and I'm meeting him early tomorrow morning at grindspaces to see a talk by Anil Dash and to talk about some freelance work for him at co on a thing for SXSW. I don't know anything more about it but at least it is something. 

Event better, I think, Joe Stump said on Twitter that sprintly is looking for a front end developer to come on which I think would be a great opportunity. The product looks amazing and exciting and while maybe not as game changing as Simple I think it could still be a big deal. Additionally Joe has the right kind of attitude as far as how engineering teams and businesses should be run from what I have seen in interviews and read in blog posts. Hopefully something there will pan out.
