We were up early-ish (09:30) because Mai agreed to do filing for Erik and Rebecca at Erik's office but we didn't really get out of the house until much later. Not for any good reason but neither of us were moving quickly and we took our time getting ready and eating breakfast.

Mai went to Erik's office to do filing and I went to the Starbucks across the street to sit and work on Persnicketly for a while. Happily, I feel like I actually made some progress though I didn't get much done on the feature I intended to work on. I wanted to get the RSS feed implemented so I could push it out but I don't have a good plan for it yet. I think I know how I would like it to work: only publish the top ten articles in the feed and an article only gets re-posted if it was out of the top ten and then back in. But despite the vision I don't have a plan for execution yet. In any case I did some other work which I believe will fix a bug or two and is worth putting in the world but I want to push both of these features together and I suppose it isn't for any good reason. I just see the work I've done as related to the feature and so they should go together but it isn't really true. I have enough to push now.

I think this is related to a problem I have with letting go of certain tasks. I have a vision for how I think the world should be and then I can't easily alter my worldview with new information to pivot (ugh, startup vernacular) my viewpoint.

In the midst of working we went and had lunch with Mai's dad at a restaurant called [Thaiphoon](http://www.thaiphoon.com/) in Pentagon Row. Thens ome more work and then dinner with Rebecca and Erik and the kids.
