Mai and I have been fighting with the Pax wardrobe doors from IKEA for several hours now. Not only do we have bent pieces but the plastic bits we needed to screw into the top were nearly impossible to get into place and hold in place while screwing them into the wardrobe. 

Not to mention the wardrobe doors had thirty-eight steps. Way more than most pieces of IKEA furniture let alone an IKEA accessory. 

All told it took us nearly seven hours to put them together. This did not at all help my general feeling of failure today. Feeling like a failure is in large part tied up with my continued unemployment. I don't know how to reach out to people and look for work, I am so accustomed to it finding me. I have sent emails to a couple of places submitting myself for positions but most of those are for full-time gigs which are not truly what I am looking for. This makes me more aware of how much of my work came through recruiters for the year I was working non-stop. I don't want to need a recruiter to find work but I think it still may be the case for me. 

I am still certain I will find work it has just become obvious it is not on my timeline but on someone else's.
