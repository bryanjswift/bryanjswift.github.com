Slept in a little late today but got up around 11:00 and though I had enough time to go for a jog before we had to shower to go meet her father for lunch we both opted out of the activity. Instead we lazed around in bed for a little while playing iPhone games (ahem, Bejeweled, ahem) before getting up to shower.

While at lunch (at Pho 75, yum) Mai's father asked about the safety of the neighborhood we were in. This is a conversation I had two days ago with my mother and again last night with Rebecca Tax. This got me wondering if there was a heat map or some other kind of information out there charting crime and location in New York City. This charting of crime information got my brain started down the path of other things (in addition to location) which could be correlated to crime statistics and data with interesting results.

After some searching on the internet I determined finding this information for NYC was impossible currently and this got me thinking more about how useful this could be to a lot of different people. I decided to reach out to Ami and Rachel to see what they thought about it. Ami got back to me first and this is what I sent along to her:

> Hey Ami,
> 
> So over the last couple of days I've had conversations with multiple people about "is the area safe" regarding the location of the apartment we found (hooray!) and so I wanted to find a heat map or some sort of map about crime types and frequencies for the area I could send to people and say "look how safe it is".
> 
> However, after some searching around the internet I was completely unable to find anything resembling current and complete data. In hindsight I should have saved links to what I was actually able to find. What I was looking for is something like http://www.trulia.com/crime/ or http://www.crimemapping.com/map/ny both of which conspicuously exclude New York City.
> 
> The first idea is to get access this information from the New York State Department of Justice (or whoever has it) and provide it in a useful but anonymized (scrubbed) format or the internet in general to do things with because I think this information is public record and it should be easily accessible but obviously protect the privacy of folks involved. 
> 
> Once the data exists and is usable I think there are a lot of interesting and useful things to be done with the data. For one some trending information for various neighborhoods would be awesome. Seeing where things are getting safer vs. more dangerous over time. Additionally it would be interesting to correlate the crime data to climate and weather and avg. rent or sale prices. And this kind of comparison information could be a useful tool to real estate agents and management companies when pricing apartments / homes as well as to potential buyers or renters. 
> 
> I recognize there would be some tricky privacy issues to navigate but from what I have found the government has standardized an XML format for presenting crime incident information (as well as arrest information but I'm not as interested in it for now) which should make passing on or using a subset of the data easy. 
> 
> Thoughts? Reactions? I'd love to hear what you think.

Followed shortly by:

> Spotcrime <http://spotcrime.com/> is advocating the kind of data distribution policies I'd like to see related to this but they are just doing the mapping of crime data they are not intersecting it with other interesting things. Plus I don't like the way the data is presented. CrimeMapping <http://www.crimemapping.com/> is presenting the crime data in a much prettier package but also not doing any real analysis or correlation.
> 
> While the basic mapping is useful I think there is a lot more to be gained from this data than simple 'how safe is this area' information.

Presently awaiting a response. I think this would be pretty awesome to work on though.
