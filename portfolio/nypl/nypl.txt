### Sabbatical 

June 2011 to December 2011 -- USA, Japan, Singapore, New Zealand

Since I had taken almost no time off since starting to do freelance work I decided it was time to break from client work and do some other things. I spent the first two months working on a personal project (http://persnicketly.com) and finishing up the last of my existing client work. Towards the end of those months I was also planning out an international vacation with my girlfriend and learning Japanese. On September 2nd we landed in Japan and headed to Ofunato in the Iwate prefecture to do tsunami relief work until September 30th. Following the relief work we traveled through Japan, visited Singapore and then toured New Zealand before arriving in California to spend the holidays with my parents.
