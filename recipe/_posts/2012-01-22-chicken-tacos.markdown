## Ingredients

* 2 - 8 oz. cans tomato sauce
* 2 t. white distilled vinegar
* 2 t. minced garlic
* 3 &frac12; t. ancho chile powder
* 1 t. ground cumin
* 2 t. oregano
* &frac12; t. sugar 
* 2 T. virgin olive oil
* 2 lbs. bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (boneless/skinless is fine too)
* Adobo to taste
* 1 - 10 oz. pkg corn tortillas, warmed

## Instructions

For  garnishes - onion, 1 lime cut into wedges, chopped cilantro, lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, salsa

In medium bowl, mix together tomato sauce, vinegar, garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, and sugar. Season with Adobo; set aside. (this is really a guess and personal preference. I usually cover the surface with a thin sprinkling).

Heat oil n large skillet, over medium-high heat. Season chicken with Adobo. Cook chicken, turning once, until light golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce mixture to skillet; bring to boil (be careful, tomato sauce splatters.) Lower heat to medium low. Simmer, covered, until cooked through (thermometer will register 170 degrees F when inserted into thickest part of breast), flipping once - cooking time is about 20 minutes.

Transfer chicken to cutting board; reserve sauce in pan. Remove and discard bones and skin. Using two forks, shred chicken breasts. Transfer shredded chicken to skillet with sauce, mixing to combine; continue to cook until sauce reduces and blends into chicken, and mixture begins to caramelize - about 10 minutes.
Transfer chicken mixture to serving bowl. Spoon into warmed corn tortillas. Garnish.

Prep Time: 10 minutes. Cook time: 40 minutes - serves 4
