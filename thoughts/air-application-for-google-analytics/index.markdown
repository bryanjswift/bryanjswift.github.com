After finding ScribeFire I started looking around the vastness of the internets for an <abbr title="Adobe Integrated Runtime">AIR</abbr> application which did something similar. I didn't find one.

What I did find was a post on <a href="http://gregorywilson.wordpress.com/2008/01/15/air-application-for-google-analytics-gets-googles-support/">Greg Wilsonâ€™s Ramblings</a> which pointed me to an AIR app which integrated with <a href="http://analytics.google.com" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> to provide a pretty slick view of the tracking statistics provided by Google's service.

The page for the <a href="http://analytics.boulevart.be/" title="Google Analytics Suite">GAS</a> application doesn't have an obvious download link because it is in the guise of the application's version (which isn't accurate anymore). If I were you I'd go direct to the <a href="http://www.aboutnico.be/index.php/downloads/" title="Google Analytics Suite download page">suite download page</a> and check it out.

It's not that I have anything against using web interfaces but I like having individual applications for pages that are quite application like but I didn't like my brief stint with application specific browsers.
