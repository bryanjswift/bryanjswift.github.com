		<h1>Selected works of Bryan J Swift</h1>
		<p>The examples of client work I am showing were completed during my time at <a href="http://akqa.com">AKQA</a>. On these projects I served as the lead front end developer but the designs were produced by the talented members of the AKQA creative department.</p>
