		<h1>Selected works of Bryan J Swift</h1>
		<p>The examples of client work I am showing were completed during my time at <a href="http://akqa.com">AKQA</a>. On these projects I served as the lead front end developer but the designs were produced by the talented members of the creative department.</p>
		<h2>Client Work</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3><a href="http://motorola.com" title="Motorola Global Site">Motorola</a></h3>
				<p>AKQA was commissioned to help Motorola rebrand, rearchitect, redesign and rebuild their global website and with the recently launched redesign my front end work is featured prominently on many of the templates/pages.</p>
				<p>I created most of the JavaScript classes and components which control the interactions between the user and the site. These elements were created in JavaScript utilizing an object oriented approach in order to facilitate code re-use on subsequent endeavors with Motorola. This project was interesting and exciting in a lot of ways because it pushed me to create lots of flexible UI components many of which replaced standard browser controls without compromising keyboard accessibility.</p>
				<p>Some of the pages I am most pleased with are the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/consumers/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=8b871df4f3d89110VgnVCM1000008406b00aRCRD&appInstanceName=default" title="Motorola Phones Browse Page">phones</a>, <a href="http://www.motorola.com/consumers/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d44832a609e89110VgnVCM1000008406b00aRCRD&appInstanceName=default" title="Motorola Accessories Browse Page">accessories</a> and the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/ch.Mobile-Phones.compare?pMotProductsToCompare=52179_57471_40906&productId=52179&productId=57471&productId=40906" title="Motorola Aura, Motorola Evoke, Motorola Rokr comparison page">product comparison page</a>. As with anything finished work there are some things I would like to change or tweak but all things considered I believe these turned out well.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><a href="http://smirnoff.com" title="Smirnoff Global Site">Smirnoff Gateway</a></h3>
				<p>Diageo was having trouble with an abnormally high dropoff rate at the age validation step prior to gaining access to the site and felt the dropoff was related to the Gateway being in Flash. So they asked AKQA to redesign and rebuild it for them.</p>
				<p>Once the creative department had finished creating an updated look in psd format it was handed off to me for top to bottom implementation. One of the more interesting challenges of this was backporting a number of MooTools plugins (which I had previously written) for use with a legacy version which broke plugin compatibility in a bunch of ways. The most enjoyable part of this project was finally getting to add better keyboard support for the MooTools dropdown replacement script I wrote.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><a href="http://bryanjswift.com/projects/bm-extranet/index.html" title="Mockup of Benjamin Moore Extranet Site">Benjamin Moore Extranet</a></h3>
				<p>The extranet project was another piece of work AKQA was commissioned to do, this time for Benjamin Moore. I'm sure by now this site is live, however as it is private all I can link to is the mock-up we delivered to them so they could integrate it with their back-end architecture. I was not as heavily involved in the coding of this project as I was in the Motorola or Smirnoff projects. I was, however, responsible for overseeing the front-end development as well as the bulk of the JavaScript work.</p>
				<p>I enjoyed this project because it required me to really dive into jQuery whereas much of my other work utilizes the MooTools framework. I'm the type of person who wants to grok a framework or tool and it's best practices before using it heavily and this design and interaction required heavy scripting and the client required jQuery.</p>
